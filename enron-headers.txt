ISO Market Participants:

On March 7, 2001, the ISO distributed funds from the March 5 market settlement of the December 2000 preliminary invoice.  The ISO distributed a total of $45,779,567.97, of which $352,693.64 was applied to outstanding November balances, and $45,426,874.33 was applied to December balances, as shown below.   Total amounts payable to Market Participants related to the December preliminary invoice were $1,490,781,469.67.  Accordingly, the preliminary pay-out ratio for December was 3.05%, and the cumulative November pay-out was 24.22%.

Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The ISO has been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action in federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v. California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central District of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that court.

Payments were made in accordance with ISO Tariff Section 11 and Settlements and Billing Protocol ("SABP") Section 6. 

The following table provides an overview of the cash settlement:

TALKING POINTS
FEDERAL INTERVENTION IN
CALIFORNIA-RELATED ENERGY LITIGATION

Message to the White House:
  
 1. The power shortages and price volatility plaguing California (the world's 7th largest economy) cannot be confined to that state.  It is now and will continue to destabilize neighboring states, including earthquake injured Washington State.  This is because California and its neighbors are mutually dependent on the same energy market, known as the Western Interconnection.  

 2. To prevent the crisis from spinning totally out of control throughout the West when we enter the period of peak power consumption this summer, we must get those affected focused on coordinated, region-wide solutions ― a combination of price responsive reduced demand and more supply ― rather than recriminations over who and what caused the crisis.

Opening Statement


Introduction
Everybody here likely agree on one thing – that prices since June of 2000 are higher than prices have been historically.  That is where our agreement ends.  We disagree on two things.  First, we disagree on what has caused these high prices.  Second, we disagree on what should be done to reduce prices in the future.

Shames, Sheffrin, and Kahn will be largely in agreement on the cause of high prices.  They assert that prices are unjust and unreasonable because they can’t be explained by market fundamentals.  While I admit that they provide some insights into the current California situation, their analysis excludes an incredibly important missing link – the impact of hydro on the western power markets and the pricing of storable commodities.  California is one piece of the entire western power puzzle.  You can’t understand California unless you understand what is going on around California. 

Gary Ackerman and I believe that the current state of despair in the western power markets has been driven by basic supply and demand.  I will present evidence illustrating the magnitude of the shortage problem throughout the western US.  In particular, I will focus on trends in hydro production in the northwest. .  And I will show that if people thought that supplies were tight last year, they are likely to be even tighter this summer.  I will then discuss how trends in hydro have impacted prices.  I will introduce a line of reasoning on the pricing of a storable commodity that has not been addressed by any of the studies done to date.

Potential Questions and Proposed Answers:


Q:  The generators and marketers have made tons of money on the backs of ratepayers.  They have brought the utilities to the verge of bankruptcy.  How do you justify this result?

A:  As I stated before, we see fundamental factors driving shortages and corresponding prices.  There are many factors unique to California:  how the utilities were permitted to purchase power, the difficulties that are well publicized in the press in building new power plants in California, weather patterns, aging power plants, growth of demand in certain locations to name just a few.  As an economist, my view is that markets respond to these factors and one of the responses is price.  I do not have enough information about all the things that the utilities did or did not do that led them to the financial position they are in today.



Q:  How do you justify the high prices that we are seeing today?

MGAG/MGL ats Codelco: Case Summary
As requested by Paul Johnson as a matter of urgency earlier today, set out below is a preliminary note on the claim made by Codelco against Metallgesellschaft AG (“MGAG”), Metallgesellschaft Ltd (“MGL”) and Wolfgang Becker (formerly the MD of MG Commodity Corp (“MGCC”), a now defunct MGAG subsidiary) in the High Court in London.  This note assumes that the reader has no previous knowledge of the claim.

Codelco, which is the national copper producer in Chile, suffered huge losses as a result of the actions of the former head of its futures department, Juan Pablo Davila during the late eighties and early nineties.  While criminal investigations against Davila in Chile are on-going, Codelco has made civil claims arising out of those investigations against traders and brokers with whom Davila dealt, including the claim now made in the High Court proceedings against MGAG and MGL.
In those proceedings (no. CH2518 of 1996), Codelco claims that the defendants were party to a conspiracy to defraud and injure Codelco.  The conspiracy is said to have been orchestrated by Becker, who is alleged to have paid a bribe of US$1.5 million to Davila in return for Davila procuring Codelco to enter into futures and options transactions with MGAG and/or its subsidiaries, including MGL.  The allegation is that those transactions were either on unduly favourable terms and/or that the volume of that business increased as a result of the payment of the bribe.
The US$1.5 million was generated by Becker increasing the options premiums payable in respect of a min-max options contract entered into between MGCC and Codelco in late 1989, early 1990.  The claim is made against MGAG, rather than MGCC, because MGCC’s contracts with Codelco were entered into using MGAG letterhead (this was because MGCC, unlike MGAG and MGL, was unable to register as a broker with the Central Bank in Chile).  Becker was authorised to operate in this way pursuant to a power of attorney granted to him by MGAG and did so through MGAG’s agent in Chile, Vorwerk SA.
Following receipt of the US$1.5 million from Codelco, Becker caused it to be paid into a Cayman Island account details of which were given to him by Davila.  A paper trail, comprising three artificial futures transactions resulting in a net payment due to Codelco, was generated by Becker to justify the transfer.
Codelco claims that both the min-max contract and all subsequent futures transactions with MGAG were induced by the alleged bribe.  Those transactions span the period April 1989 to January 1994, when Davila was dismissed from Codelco.
MGL’s futures business transacted with Codelco during the same period is said to have been induced by the alleged bribe for two reasons.  First, Codelco claims that because MGL was MGAG’s subsidiary and had common directors and/or officers (ie, Dieter Worms), it can be inferred that MGL knew of the bribe and benefited from it.  Secondly, it is claimed that MGL knew of and benefited from the payment of the bribe because shortly after the min-max contract was entered into, MGL retained MGAG’s agent in Chile who had acted in connection with its entry into the min-max contract, namely, Vorwerk SA.  On the basis of the alleged joint agency of Vowerk SA, Codelco claims that Vorwerk SA’s knowledge of the bribe is to be imputed to MGL.
The defence case is that no bribe was paid and that the transfer payment was simply an accommodation made to Codelco, at its request, to transfer funds abroad on the understanding that they were required to purchase medical equipment for a military hospital in Chile.  The defendants claim that Davila requested Becker to make the transfer for that purpose; that the transfer was authorised and approved by the then President of Codelco, Patricio Contesse, in a meeting called by Vorwerk for that purpose; that after the min-max contract had been agreed, Davila requested the increase in the premiums to facilitate the payment; and that it was always understood that the Cayman Island account into which the US$1.5 million was transferred was a Codelco account (it only subsequently became apparent that it was Davila’s personal account).  In fact, US$500,000 of the transfer payment was used to purchase medical equipment for the Hospital Militar in Santiago costing US$1,060,000.  The balance of the purchase price, namely US$560,000, was paid by the Chilean Army.  We are currently investigating this matter in Chile.

MCGRATH & COMPANY
               PRIVATE INVESTMENT BANKING

Report of F. Gerard McGrath
 I have been requested by Alschuler, Grossman, Stein & Kahan, LLC, on behalf of defendant ECT Securities Limited Partnership to prepare a report opining on the reasonableness of the due diligence performed by the defendant (and its affiliates, as described below) in connection with the $452,500,000 Mortgage Notes and Units offering in March 1998 (the "NSM Offering") by NSM Steel (Delaware, Inc.) and NSM Steel Co., Ltd., both subsidiaries of Nakornthai Strip Mill Public Company, Ltd., ("NSM") as presented in the action Farallon Capital Partners, L.P., et al. v. Gleacher & Co., Inc., et al.  and Legg Mason High Yield Portfolio v. Gleacher & Co., Inc., et al. (the "California NSM Litigation").  
ECT Securities Limited Partnership (previously, ECT Securities Corp.) is a wholly-owned, registered broker/dealer subsidiary of Enron Corporation.  The due diligence relating to this offering was carried out principally by personnel in another subsidiary, Enron Capital and Trade, as well, to a lesser extent, by personnel in several other subsidiaries or departments of Enron Corporation, all of whom were acting on behalf of, and in conjunction with, ECT Securities Corp. (collectively, "ECT").
As part of this engagement, and as more fully described below, I have spoken with several members of the ECT staff who were principally involved in performing or reviewing Enron's due diligence, and have reviewed ECT's files as well as additional documents and materials available in the public record pertaining to this transaction.

REQUEST

"Enron is a marketing company�not a generator.  As the Commission has recognized, �Marketers generally have a portfolio of energy supplies and often sell energy numerous times.  It, therefore, would be exceedingly difficult to try and trace energy back to the generating source to determine the heat rate of the source.  Indeed, if multiple sources are used, one could not isolate which source provided the power for the marketer�s bid.�  Docket no. EL00-95-012, Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale Electric Markets and Establishing an Investigation of Public Utility Rates in Wholesale Western Energy Markets, p. 16.  Similarly, Enron operates its trading business on a portfolio basis rather than on a transaction by transaction basis.  Thus, Enron generally does not attempt to coordinate bid, awarded bid, purchases and sales on a transaction by transaction basis.  For these reasons, Enron is providing information that it has available and called for in response to this request.  Often Enron has had to make its best judgement as to cost based upon the information it has and in some cases the costs are estimates.  During the period in question, Enron made transactions on its own behalf and as a scheduling coordinator for other entities.  The amount of information available to Enron varies depending on whether the transaction was for its own account or on behalf of another entity. In many instances the components of cost for service transactions were estimates. Enron understands this request as calling for information about bids submitted that were in excess of $150 MWh that were awarded.  Enron believes that it has a copy of bids that were submitted to the California ISO for the fourth quarter of 2000.  Enron also has records of some CalPX day ahead bids.  Enron does not have retained records of bids that it submitted to the CalPX day-of market.   Enron did not have a business reason for retaining complete CalPX bid information.  But without complete CalPX bid data, Enron is not able to provide detailed information about those transactions.  There is also the possibility, especially for real time transactions, that Enron�s data may differ slightly from ISO and CalPX data since often last minute changes were made that may not have entered on Enron�s records.  Based upon Enron�s retained business records, the vast majority of Enron�s bids to supply energy submitted the to ISO and the CalPX during the period in question were effectively �price taker� bids (e.g $2.00 MWh).  Enron has identified 5 hourly bids in the ISO Supplemental Day Ahead energy market that were awarded where the bid price exceeded $150.  Enron has identified a few hundred hours where Enron sold power to the ISO out-of-market.   Enron has located some of the data requested for out-of-market transactions and will produce it.  Enron will supplement its response with additional out-of-market information as it is identified.  Enron has not been able to identify out-of-sequence transactions called for by this request, in-so-far as Enron understands that term.  Enron is still reviewing its records to determine what bids were awarded for ancillary services were made in the ISO day ahead market where the bid price is over $150.  Enron will supplement its response to this request when those transactions have been identified and the corresponding information located.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arguments For ESP Recovery of Negative CTC


The utilities entered into stipulations with Enron and the Western Power Trading Forum that eliminated the zero minimum bill.  The CPUC in Decision D.99-06-058 explicitly approved the above stipulations that included elimination of the zero minimum bill, thereby specifically overturning an earlier CPUC decision in D.97-08-056 and Energy Resolution E-3510 that established the maximum PX Credit equal to the otherwise applicable bundled bill such that a customer would not receive a negative bill (credit), even if the PX Credit exceeded the total bundled bill.


Following D.99-06-058, the utilities in their tariffs dropped language from the billing portion of the various customer tariffs that restricted the PX Credit to a zero minimum bill.  The current language for direct access customers now reads:  "The bill will be calculated as for a Bundled Service Customer, but the customer will receive a credit for the Power Exchange Component."  The change in the tariff language was effective on June 10, 1999 the date of D.99-06-058.  The tariff language change references D.99-06-058.

SCE COUNTER-CLAIM
(usage under-reporting)

Nature of the Claim

SCE is alleging, as a potential offset to Enron’s claim for unpaid PX credits, that EES and EEMC “underreported” to the ISO the amount of usage of their direct access customers between the period of June 2000 to “the present” (the time SCE filed counter-claim).  In other words, Enron’s DA customers were using more energy than Enron was reporting to the ISO, with the differential being made up by the market. 

SCE’s claim is based on the difference between the Enron settlement date reported to the ISO and data extracted from SCE’s internal systems. 

As SCE had paid a PX credit to Enron based on customers’ usage as recorded in its own internal systems, it claims that it overpaid Enron as Enron had not supplied all that energy (i.e., Enron only supplied that amount reported to the ISO).

Dear California Customer,
While we have continued to provide your electricity service, the California electricity market has radically changed.  Unfortunately, as a result of continued uncertainty in the California electricity market, as well as a lack of clarity on the future of direct access, we will no longer serve residential customers in California.  
This letter serves as notice of cancellation of your electricity service.  There will be no disruption in your electricity service, and you will return to the regulated rate structure of your local utility.  We will facilitate the transfer of your service back to your utility.  In approximately one month, your utility will once again provide you with electricity and bill you for the service. 
We appreciated the opportunity to serve you.  Enron believes that, when properly structured, competition will bring benefits to all California consumers.  Should you have any questions about your change of service, contact your Enron representative at 1-888-367-6610.  However, no action is required on your part.  
Sincerely,

Steve,

I will be sending a second invoice to Enron at the end of this week.  It would be useful if the first invoice was paid so that we are not dealing with a "past due" item.

Why is the engagement letter and bill paying process such a taffy-pull?  It takes only seconds to approve an invoice for payment.

The Enron Parties understand that there is no meaningful dispute that these cases, all of which arise out of the California energy crisis and all of which raise similar issues regarding the alleged exercise of market power in the California wholesale electric markets, should be consolidated for pretrial purposes.  The primary issue the Panel must address is where the cases should be consolidated, not whether they should be consolidated.
 2. The Enron Parties submit that recent events in California--and, in particular, recent statements by California’s Attorney General--underscore the importance of placing this matter before a Court in a neutral venue.
 3. California is not an appropriate venue for pretrial proceedings in this case.  The issues arising from this case have become increasingly politicized in California.  Recent comments by Bill Lockyer, California’s attorney general, show the degree to which political considerations have infected issues arising from and related to California’s power crisis.  On May 13, 2001, for example, an interview with Mr. Lockyer was published in which he stated (1) that he did not have evidence sufficient to support either a civil or criminal prosecution, Exh. “A” attached hereto (“My staff estimates that it would take a couple more months to get enough evidence collected to see if we have a viable civil or criminal action against the generators.”); (2) that he nevertheless has filed and intends to file additional such suits in the future, including a claim of “racketeering,” id.; (3) that the purpose of filing such proceedings is to force out-of-state market participants to give refunds, id.; and (4) that the defendants in such actions likely cannot get a fair trial in California, id. (“I think the generators must realize that if we ever get them into court in California they may be considered guilty before the trial begins.”).
 4. Mr. Lockyer was quoted yesterday making even more inflammatory and inappropriate remarks: “I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike, honey.'” See Exh. “B” attached hereto.  These comments are being made despite the complete inability of either Mr. Lockyer or anyone else to identify any misconduct justifying the statements--Mr. Lockyer himself admitted that he had no idea whether anything improper had in fact occurred.  Id. (“While the energy suppliers are generating ‘unconscionable profits,’ the question remains ‘whether they are illegal profits,’ says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer . . . .”).  It should go without saying that it is not only improper and unethical for California’s Attorney General to make such statements, it is also irresponsible.  Mr. Lockyer is California’s chief law enforcement officer--for him to encourage behavior of the type described is outrageous.
 5. More to the point, these statements and the other accusations made by various public officials in the State of California quoted in Exh. “B” reflect the highly politicized environment surrounding these issues in California.  Under these circumstances, conducting pretrial proceedings in these cases in California would turn the proceedings into a three-ring-circus in which politicians and other interested parties attempt to influence jurists, jurors, and the public through inflammatory rhetoric.  It makes little sense to force the cases into such an environment when, as here, a neutral forum exists where political rhetoric can be minimized.  For these reasons, Enron recommends to the panel that these cases be consolidated in Washington, D.C.

DRAFT 8/1/00
  On March 2, 1998, Claimant's predecessor, ECT Securities Corp. ("ECTSC"), along with three other parties (together with ECTSC, the "Purchasers"), entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Nakornthai Strip Mill Public Company Limited ("NSM"), and two of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (the "Note Issuers" and, together with NSM, the "Issuers"), whereby the Note Issuers agreed to issue and sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to buy from the Note Issuers, $249,000,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity of 12% Senior Mortgage Notes Due 2006 guaranteed by NSM (the "Senior Notes"), $203,500,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity of 12 ¼  Senior Subordinated Mortgage Notes Due 2008 guaranteed by NSM (the "Senior Subordinated Notes"), and warrants to purchase 128,834,356 ordinary shares, par value 10 Baht per share, of NSM (the "Warrants" and, together with the Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes, the "NSM Securities").  See Purchase Agreement, Section 1.  A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
  The Purchase Agreement contemplated that the Purchasers would resell the NSM Securities by means of an Offering Document prepared by the Issuers and which the Issuers represented to the Purchasers was true and complete.  See Purchase Agreement, Section 2(a).  Further in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuers jointly and severally indemnified each of the Purchasers, including ECTSC, from any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, arising out of any untrue statement in, or material omission from, the Offering Document, except for information supplied by Purchasers.  See Purchase Agreement, Section 7.
  Subsequent to the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Claimant succeeded to all of the rights of ECTSC under the Purchase Agreement.  See Purchase Agreement, Section 11.
During 1999, two lawsuits were filed in the United States, State of California, against Claimant, the other Purchasers, and others, by plaintiffs who had purchased Securities from one or more of the Purchasers allegedly on the basis of the Offering Document, which the plaintiffs alleged had been false and had caused the plaintiffs to lose millions of dollars (the "California Suits").  One of the California Suits (the "Farallon/Oaktree Suit") was brought by two groups of plaintiffs, Farallon ……[sabina, fill in all Farallon Ps, but not the Oaktree Ps] …. (the "Farallon Plaintiffs") and …[oaktree Ps]….(the "Oaktree Plaintiffs").   The Farallon Plaintiffs seeks damages of $_____________; the Oaktree Plaintiffs seek damages of $____________.  The Oaktree Plaintiffs have subsequently dismissed Claimant from the Farallon/Oaktree Suit but are still pursuing their claims against the other defendants; the Farallon Plaintiffs are pursuing their claims against all defendants, including Claimant.  A copy of the First Amended Complaint in the Farallon/Oaktree Suit is attached hereto as Exhibit B
The other California Suit (the "Legg Mason Suit") was brought by   ……….….(the "Legg Mason Plaintiffs").  The Legg Mason Plaintiffs seek damages of $________.  A copy of the First Amended Complaint in the Legg Mason Suit is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
Although Claimant believes that it has meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs' claims in the California Suits, Claimant in theory could incur judgments, either in favor of the plaintiffs or possibly in favor of other defendants against Claimant for indemnification or contribution, if any defendants pursue such claims, up to the total amount of damages sought by all plaintiffs in the California Suits, i.e., $__________ .  In addition, Claimant is incurring attorneys fees and costs to defend the California Actions.  Through June 30, 2000, such fees and costs totalled $____________.  The additional fees and costs to take the California Suits to trial, not including appeals, could easily be another $1 million.
Under the Purchase Agreement, and under the statutory and common law of the United States and the State of California, Claimant is entitled to complete or partial indemnification or contribution from each of the Issuers, including NSM, with respect to any judgment suffered by Claimant in either California Suit and all costs of defending each suit.
In addition to the California Suits, other plaintiffs who purchased NSM Securities have brought a total of _____ additional suits (the "Additional Suits") against defendants other than Claimant and are seeking a total of $__________ in damages based on alleged falsifications in the Offering Document.  Copies of the complaints in the Additional Suits are attached hereto as Exhibits D, __, __, __, and __.  While none of the plaintiffs in the Additional Suits have named Claimant, or any of its affiliates, as a defendant, the time for plaintiffs' doing so may not have lapsed.  In addition, one or more of the defendants in the Additional Suits might seek indemnification and/or contribution from Claimant.  In theory, Claimants' exposure could be as high as $___________ plus the costs of defense were Claimants brought into any of the Additional Suits.

("Brazos Electric"), having an office at 2404 LaSalle Avenue, Waco, Texas 76706, TENASKA IV TEXAS PARTNERS, Ltd., (“Tenaska”) having an office at 89 Headquarters Plaza, North Tower, 14th Floor, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, PONDEROSA PINE ENERGY, LLC, (“PPE”), having an office at 89 Headquarters Plaza, North Tower, 14th Floor, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, ECT MERCHANT INVESTMENTS CORP.

R E C I T A L S:
WHEREAS, Brazos Electric and Tenaska are parties to a certain Purchase Power Agreement dated November 1, 1993, as thereafter amended from time to time (“PPA”);

WHEREAS, PPE, and ECT, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron, has represented to Brazos Electric that they have obtained all of the ownership interest in Tenaska and its managing partners Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd.

AGREEMENT TO EXTEND SECOND INTERIM AGREEMENT
AND WAIVER REGARDING INCREMENTAL CAPACITY
FROM THE TENASKA CLEBURNE PLANT

[Q:  Does this action require bank consent?]

This Agreement (the "Agreement") is made as of the _______ day of October, 2000, by and between BRAZOS ELECTRIC POWER COOPERATIVE, INC. ("Brazos Electric"), having an office at 2404 LaSalle Avenue, Waco, Texas 76706, TENASKA IV TEXAS PARTNERS, Ltd., (“Tenaska”) having an office at 89 Headquarters Plaza, North Tower, 14th Floor, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, PONDEROSA PINE ENERGY, LLC, (“PPE”), having an office at 89 Headquarters Plaza, North Tower, 14th Floor, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, ECT MERCHANT INVESTMENTS CORP.

The PPA is between Tenaska IV and Brazos Electric.  Does it make sense for this agreement to (1) address the preservation of rights to challenge the PPA and Cornhusker transaction and/or (2) involve other parties beyond Tenaska IV and Brazos?]

MGAG/MGL ats Codelco: Case Summary
As requested by Paul Johnson as a matter of urgency earlier today, set out below is a preliminary note on the claim made by Codelco against Metallgesellschaft AG (“MGAG”), Metallgesellschaft Ltd (“MGL”) and Wolfgang Becker (formerly the MD of MG Commodity Corp (“MGCC”), a now defunct MGAG subsidiary) in the High Court in London.  This note assumes that the reader has no previous knowledge of the claim.

Codelco, which is the national copper producer in Chile, suffered huge losses as a result of the actions of the former head of its futures department, Juan Pablo Davila during the late eighties and early nineties.  While criminal investigations against Davila in Chile are on-going, Codelco has made civil claims arising out of those investigations against traders and brokers with whom Davila dealt, including the claim now made in the High Court proceedings against MGAG and MGL.
In those proceedings (no. CH2518 of 1996), Codelco claims that the defendants were party to a conspiracy to defraud and injure Codelco.  The conspiracy is said to have been orchestrated by Becker, who is alleged to have paid a bribe of US$1.5 million to Davila in return for Davila procuring Codelco to enter into futures and options transactions with MGAG and/or its subsidiaries, including MGL.  The allegation is that those transactions were either on unduly favourable terms and/or that the volume of that business increased as a result of the payment of the bribe.
The US$1.5 million was generated by Becker increasing the options premiums payable in respect of a min-max options contract entered into between MGCC and Codelco in late 1989, early 1990.  The claim is made against MGAG, rather than MGCC, because MGCC’s contracts with Codelco were entered into using MGAG letterhead (this was because MGCC, unlike MGAG and MGL, was unable to register as a broker with the Central Bank in Chile).  Becker was authorised to operate in this way pursuant to a power of attorney granted to him by MGAG and did so through MGAG’s agent in Chile, Vorwerk SA.
Following receipt of the US$1.5 million from Codelco, Becker caused it to be paid into a Cayman Island account details of which were given to him by Davila.  A paper trail, comprising three artificial futures transactions resulting in a net payment due to Codelco, was generated by Becker to justify the transfer.
Codelco claims that both the min-max contract and all subsequent futures transactions with MGAG were induced by the alleged bribe.  Those transactions span the period April 1989 to January 1994, when Davila was dismissed from Codelco.
MGL’s futures business transacted with Codelco during the same period is said to have been induced by the alleged bribe for two reasons.  First, Codelco claims that because MGL was MGAG’s subsidiary and had common directors and/or officers (ie, Dieter Worms), it can be inferred that MGL knew of the bribe and benefited from it.  Secondly, it is claimed that MGL knew of and benefited from the payment of the bribe because shortly after the min-max contract was entered into, MGL retained MGAG’s agent in Chile who had acted in connection with its entry into the min-max contract, namely, Vorwerk SA.  On the basis of the alleged joint agency of Vowerk SA, Codelco claims that Vorwerk SA’s knowledge of the bribe is to be imputed to MGL.
The defence case is that no bribe was paid and that the transfer payment was simply an accommodation made to Codelco, at its request, to transfer funds abroad on the understanding that they were required to purchase medical equipment for a military hospital in Chile.  The defendants claim that Davila requested Becker to make the transfer for that purpose; that the transfer was authorised and approved by the then President of Codelco, Patricio Contesse, in a meeting called by Vorwerk for that purpose; that after the min-max contract had been agreed, Davila requested the increase in the premiums to facilitate the payment; and that it was always understood that the Cayman Island account into which the US$1.5 million was transferred was a Codelco account (it only subsequently became apparent that it was Davila’s personal account).  In fact, US$500,000 of the transfer payment was used to purchase medical equipment for the Hospital Militar in Santiago costing US$1,060,000.  The balance of the purchase price, namely US$560,000, was paid by the Chilean Army.  We are currently investigating this matter in Chile.

Re: California Electricity Market Investigations and Potential Litigation
Dear Alvin:
We are pleased that Portland General Electric Company (“PGE”) has asked us to perform an audit of  the trading practices of PGE concerning the above-referenced investigations (the “Subject Matters”).  As you know, we are representing Enron Corporation, Enron Power Marketing Incorporated, Enron North America, Enron Energy Services, and other related Enron entities (“Enron Entities”) in connection with the same above-referenced investigations and litigation.  PGE is currently part of the Enron corporate family, but may at some point in the future be sold.  We presently anticipate that we will be representing both PGE, as described above, and the other Enron Entities in the above-referenced matters until such point that PGE is no longer part of the Enron Corporate family.
Based on the information that has been provided to us, we do not believe that our representation currently involves any actual conflict of interest.  You should be aware, however, that our representation at some point in the future may involve actual conflicts of interests if the interests of the Enron Entities become inconsistent with your interests.  Should that occur, we will endeavor to apprise you promptly of any such conflict so that you can decide whether you wish to obtain independent counsel.

To prevent the crisis from spinning totally out of control throughout the West when we enter the period of peak power consumption this summer, we must get those affected focused on coordinated, region-wide solutions ― a combination of price responsive reduced demand and more supply ― rather than recriminations over who and what caused the crisis.

EPMI’s Answer to ISO’s Comments on Commission Staff’s Market Monitoring and Mitigation Plan

Draft Text
Note: this is suggested text for use by B&P in the Motion to Leave to File Answer and Answer that accompanies SA’s affidavit.

Introduction and Summary: 

In the Comments of the California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO) on Staff’s Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market (CAISO Comments), CAISO recognizes the dire situation it faces this summer (CAISO Comments, p. 13).  Unfortunately that is where CAISO’s grasp of reality ends.  CAISO points fingers, provides scapegoats, and puts its customers at risk for severe reliability problems this summer. Nowhere, however, does CAISO provide any real solutions to the problems it or its customers face.  Other than propose ways of stealing power from neighboring states, the CAISO plan does nothing that will increase supply or decrease demand.

BPA response to California ISO study
BPA Fact Sheet
April 13, 2001

This fact sheet addresses statements in a recent L.A. Times article asserting that BPA, among others, manipulated prices on the California electricity market.  For additional information, contact Steve Oliver at (503) 230-3295. 
Background
An April 11, 2001 article in the L.A. Times reported that the California Independent System Operator (Cal ISO) had performed a study accusing numerous marketers, including BPA and three other government agencies, of “consistently trying to inflate prices.”  The article further states that, according to the study, BPA “. . . reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied.  Bonneville was in the top five accused of taking excessive profits.”

The article adds that the California spot market was designed so that all suppliers offering power received the same price, which equaled the highest bid accepted by the California ISO in any hour.

Governor Davis’ Power Grab
Latest Threats from California May be Overreaching
by
Adam Wenner, Partner
Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.

 In his ongoing effort to regain political credibility in the California energy crisis, Governor Gray Davis has fired a shot across the bow of the “out of state” wholesale power sellers.  He’s announced that he is considering signing a “windfall” profits tax bill.  Even more alarming, the Governor has suggested that he might commandeer power produced by those companies’ plants, or even seize the plants themselves.
 This is tough talk from an elected official who is in an understandably difficult position.  He faces a summer during which his aspirations to a future in national politics may melt in the California sun.  Nonetheless, the tough talk ignores the limitations on a state government’s ability to override federal legislation, not to mention the authority the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution reserves to the federal government. 
 In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the State of Rhode Island could not regulate rates for wholesale power sales to Massachusetts, since the Commerce Clause provides that only the federal government may regulate this type of interstate activity.  In response, in 1935, Congress passed the Federal Power Act, creating the Federal Power Commission (which later became the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) and granting it exclusive authority to determine “just and reasonable” rates for wholesale power sales in interstate commerce.
 Subsequently, a series of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court, including one involving California, held that where the integrated power grid crosses state lines, such as in the western United States and Florida, wholesale power sales that use the grid are “in interstate commerce,” even if the power is produced and consumed in the same state.  Therefore, those sales are subject to exclusive regulation by the FERC.  Several Supreme Court decisions hold that state laws that directly or indirectly interfere with FERC-set rates are invalid.  For example, in Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg, a 1986 case out of North Carolina, the court majority said, “[a] State must … give effect to Congress’ desire to give FERC plenary authority over interstate wholesale rates, and to ensure that the States do not interfere with this authority.”

PRESS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


TORONTO, October 17, 2000 – The Canfibre Group Limited (“CanFibre”) has been advised by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. (“PWC”), the trustee in bankruptcy for Kafus Industries Ltd. (”Kafus”), that the British Columbia Supreme Court has issued an order which contemplates the assignment of all of the shares of CanFibre owned or controlled by bankrupt Kafus to ECT Merchant Investments Inc. (“ECTMI”) and related entities.  Kafus owns or controls approximately 86% of the issued shares of CanFibre.  The order was made after PWC advised the creditors of Kafus that it does not perceive any value in the shares of CFGL, and that it would not take any further steps against CFGL to collect monies owed by CFGL and related entities to Kafus..  There is no guarantee that any assignment will be completed.  Any assignment is subject to regulatory approval including the approval of the securities regulatory authorities across Canada to permit the assignment to proceed as an exempt take-over bid pursuant to take-over bid legislation.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
KAFUS INDUSTRIES & SUBSIDIARIES

In connection with our visits to Kafus Industries’ corporate headquarters and several project locations, we identified the following significant issues:

Controls – Cash management and accounting cutoff issues


There are loose controls over expense reports.  For example, the Company pays the Chairman’s entire American Express bill and records any personal expenses, as identified by the Chairman, to a receivable account.  These amounts are later offset against amounts owed by the Company to the Chairman.
Travel and entertainment expenses appear to be abnormally high for a Company in this stage of development and for the Company’s overall working capital position.

Enron Metals – English Litigation



Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile (“Codelco”) v. MG Ltd. (“MGL”) and Metallgesellscaft (”MG”)


Codelco alleges that it was induced to enter into a number of metals contracts with MGL and MG during the period from January 1990 to January 1994 as a result of an alleged bribe of $1.5 million allegedly paid by MG to a Codelco employee.

While advancing these goals, the Department’s testing of technology alternatives is hoped to provide a springboard for implementation of similar alternatives by other groups within the company.

The overall goal of the plan is to ensure the client continues to view the members of the Department as essential members of the business team.  To accomplish this, the plan focuses on the following general areas:

MGAG/MGL ats Codelco: Case Summary
As requested by Paul Johnson as a matter of urgency earlier today, set out below is a preliminary note on the claim made by Codelco against Metallgesellschaft AG (“MGAG”), Metallgesellschaft Ltd (“MGL”) and Wolfgang Becker (formerly the MD of MG Commodity Corp (“MGCC”), a now defunct MGAG subsidiary) in the High Court in London.  This note assumes that the reader has no previous knowledge of the claim.

Codelco, which is the national copper producer in Chile, suffered huge losses as a result of the actions of the former head of its futures department, Juan Pablo Davila during the late eighties and early nineties.  While criminal investigations against Davila in Chile are on-going, Codelco has made civil claims arising out of those investigations against traders and brokers with whom Davila dealt, including the claim now made in the High Court proceedings against MGAG and MGL.
In those proceedings (no. CH2518 of 1996), Codelco claims that the defendants were party to a conspiracy to defraud and injure Codelco.  The conspiracy is said to have been orchestrated by Becker, who is alleged to have paid a bribe of US$1.5 million to Davila in return for Davila procuring Codelco to enter into futures and options transactions with MGAG and/or its subsidiaries, including MGL.  The allegation is that those transactions were either on unduly favourable terms and/or that the volume of that business increased as a result of the payment of the bribe.
The US$1.5 million was generated by Becker increasing the options premiums payable in respect of a min-max options contract entered into between MGCC and Codelco in late 1989, early 1990.  The claim is made against MGAG, rather than MGCC, because MGCC’s contracts with Codelco were entered into using MGAG letterhead (this was because MGCC, unlike MGAG and MGL, was unable to register as a broker with the Central Bank in Chile).  Becker was authorised to operate in this way pursuant to a power of attorney granted to him by MGAG and did so through MGAG’s agent in Chile, Vorwerk SA.
Following receipt of the US$1.5 million from Codelco, Becker caused it to be paid into a Cayman Island account details of which were given to him by Davila.  A paper trail, comprising three artificial futures transactions resulting in a net payment due to Codelco, was generated by Becker to justify the transfer.
Codelco claims that both the min-max contract and all subsequent futures transactions with MGAG were induced by the alleged bribe.  Those transactions span the period April 1989 to January 1994, when Davila was dismissed from Codelco.
MGL’s futures business transacted with Codelco during the same period is said to have been induced by the alleged bribe for two reasons.  First, Codelco claims that because MGL was MGAG’s subsidiary and had common directors and/or officers (ie, Dieter Worms), it can be inferred that MGL knew of the bribe and benefited from it.  Secondly, it is claimed that MGL knew of and benefited from the payment of the bribe because shortly after the min-max contract was entered into, MGL retained MGAG’s agent in Chile who had acted in connection with its entry into the min-max contract, namely, Vorwerk SA.  On the basis of the alleged joint agency of Vowerk SA, Codelco claims that Vorwerk SA’s knowledge of the bribe is to be imputed to MGL.
The defence case is that no bribe was paid and that the transfer payment was simply an accommodation made to Codelco, at its request, to transfer funds abroad on the understanding that they were required to purchase medical equipment for a military hospital in Chile.  The defendants claim that Davila requested Becker to make the transfer for that purpose; that the transfer was authorised and approved by the then President of Codelco, Patricio Contesse, in a meeting called by Vorwerk for that purpose; that after the min-max contract had been agreed, Davila requested the increase in the premiums to facilitate the payment; and that it was always understood that the Cayman Island account into which the US$1.5 million was transferred was a Codelco account (it only subsequently became apparent that it was Davila’s personal account).  In fact, US$500,000 of the transfer payment was used to purchase medical equipment for the Hospital Militar in Santiago costing US$1,060,000.  The balance of the purchase price, namely US$560,000, was paid by the Chilean Army.  We are currently investigating this matter in Chile.

Re:       Deposition of Rajiv Patel

  The deposition of Rajiv Patel, an analyst for Farallon Capital Partners, commenced today in San Francisco.  Patel analyzed Farallon’s original NSM investment and recommended it to Bill Mellin, who made the actual investment decision for Farallon.
Patel is Indian, very nice looking, no noticeable accent, a good combination of nice and yet firm, not at all defensive--frankly a pretty good witness.

Re:       Continuing Deposition of Rajiv Patel

  The deposition of Rajiv Patel continued today.  I asked questions for about two hours.  The rest of the day was taken up by questions by counsel for PaineWebber.  I stayed for only a portion of these questions.
  Throughout the first four days of his deposition, Patel was appealing, firm, thorough, and strong.  He is very smart and extremely well prepared.  Defense counsel collectively believe that Patel is the best plaintiff’s witness in all of the NSM cases.

 I have been requested by Alschuler Grossman Stein & Kahan, LLC, on behalf of defendant ECT Securities Limited Partnership to prepare a report opining on the reasonableness of the due diligence performed by its predecessor, ECT Securities Corp. (and its affiliates, as described below), in connection with the $452,500,000 Mortgage Notes and Units offering in March 1998 (the "NSM Offering") by NSM Steel (Delaware, Inc.) and NSM Steel Co., Ltd., both subsidiaries of Nakornthai Strip Mill Public Company, Ltd., ("NSM") as presented in the actions Farallon Capital Partners, L.P., et al. v. Gleacher & Co., Inc., et al.  and Legg Mason High Yield Portfolio v. Gleacher & Co., Inc., et al. (the "California NSM Litigation").  
ECT Securities Limited Partnership (previously, ECT Securities Corp.) is a wholly-owned, registered broker/dealer subsidiary of Enron Corporation.  The due diligence relating to this offering was carried out principally by personnel in another subsidiary, Enron Capital and Trade, as well as, to a lesser extent, by personnel in several other subsidiaries or departments of Enron Corporation, all of whom were acting on behalf of, and in conjunction with, ECT Securities Corp. (collectively, "ECT").
As part of this engagement, and as more fully described below, I have spoken with several members of the ECT staff who were principally involved in performing or reviewing ECT's due diligence, and have reviewed ECT's files as well as additional documents and materials available in the public record pertaining to this transaction.

BACKGROUND



The Canadian Competition Bureau has initiated an investigation of certain transactions involving Enron and Powerex during the period from June to October of 1999.
Apparently on referral from the Alberta Power Pool, the Bureau is investigating whether Enron and Powerex colluded or engaged in “bid rigging” in certain power sales into the Alberta Power Pool.
The Bureau sent investigators to Enron and Powerex’s offices for several days at the end of May.  Enron and Powerex did complete certain purchase and sale transactions during this period wherein Enron purchased power from Powerex and, on most occasions, was able to sell power into the Alberta Pool at a price higher than what it paid Powerex.  For 22 hours during this period it appears that Enron’s sale established the market clearing price.
The Alberta Pool has a price cap of $1,000/MWh.  Enron’s market clearing sales ranged from less than $100/MWh to as high as $998.

Citrus Trading Corp. (“Citrus”) requests Duke Energy LNG Sales, Inc.’s (“Duke”) assurance of performance under the Amendment and Restatement of Gas Purchase Contract (the “Transaction Agreement”).  This request has become necessary due to Duke’s decision to convey its LNG tankers to the Nigerian LNG company, resulting in periodic delivery problems.  Citrus must be assured that Duke will be able to satisfy its commitments under the Transaction Agreement to provide LNG in a timely manner year-round.

The following events have caused Citrus to become insecure about Duke’s ability to meet its commitments under the Transaction Agreement.


Duke re-worked its transportation deal with Sonatrach wherein Sonatrach undertook responsibility for shipping LNG from Algeria to Lake Charles during the winter months.


Duke subsequently conveyed its only two LNG tankers to the Nigerian LNG company, leaving itself open to the possibility of not being able to secure an LNG tanker to convey the LNG to Lake Charles during the winter months.

California Electricity Investigations
Executive Summary
October 30, 2000

Overview As a result of the high electrical energy prices in California during the summer of 2000, Enron is aware of at least six separate investigations by governmental entities:  FERC, California PUC, United States General Accounting Office, California Controller, the California Legislature and California State Attorney General.  At least one PUC commissioner has stated publicly that it is the Commission’s goal to extract profits from market participants to pay for high energy prices.  On October 27th, PG&E filed an application to pass on $3.0 billion dollars in electrical costs to ratepayers. 
You have asked us to consider what legal theories these various investigators or others might use against Enron to establish civil or criminal liability.  Because we do not have a detailed understanding of all of the transactions that occurred during the summer of 2000, a large portion of our analysis is necessarily theoretical.  We do not attempt to speculate on specific Enron fact patterns here.  Instead, we provide here a broad brush overview focusing on the wholesale market and discuss particular theories in detail below.
Summary of Predominant Legal Theories Most of the legal theories we considered have a common theme – conduct in the market that is deemed to be deceptive,  fraudulent or have improperly influenced the price of electricity.   Assuming that there is no preemption by FERC (discussed below), then the most likely legal theories for most claimants will be (1) federal and state antitrust claims for either price fixing or collusive behavior with other market participants to affect price; and (2) California state unfair competition law, Business and Professions Code §17200.   If Enron is found to have engaged in deceptive or fraudulent practices, there is also the risk of other criminal legal theories such as wire fraud, RICO, fraud involving markets and fictitious commodity transactions.  In addition, depending upon the conduct, there may be the potential for criminal charges prosecuted against both individuals and the company.  
On the other hand, if the company has profited solely because of its skill, by accident or the result of a regulatory scheme created by others, it is unlikely that these legal theories will be successful ultimately.  Given the amount of money at stake (reported to be between 3 and 4 billion), we believe it is safe to assume that many potential claimants will believe it worthwhile to look long and hard  before reaching a conclusion as to where Enron’s conduct falls on the continuum.  
There is the possibility that some claimants and legal theories will be preempted because of FERC’s primary jurisdiction over the wholesale market.  For purposes of this analysis, we have assumed that if FERC’s jurisdiction preempts all other federal and state claims, then Enron is in somewhat uncharted waters.  Historically FERC has taken the view that it can not retroactively change rates it has approved.  If that view prevails, then it would seem unlikely that FERC would require some form of disgorgement of profits or payment of damages.
Potential Claimants Enron potentially could face claims from the federal government in the form of FERC or the Justice Department, state governments in the WSCC region, market participants as well as commercial and retail customers under  the above described federal and state regulatory, statutory and common law theories.

CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE/ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT


This memorandum summarizes some of the trading strategies that the traders are using in the Cal PX and CAISO markets.  Each of these strategies is identified by the traders’ nickname for it. 

“Load Shift”

The profits here are earned by shifting load from a congested zone to a less congested zone, thereby earning payments for reducing congestion (unused FTRs).

ENFOLIO® GAS PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
(RESERVES COMMITTED/INDEX PRICING)         

Houston Pipe Line Company, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), and Pintail Production Company, Inc., a Texas corporation (as seller and Seller's Representative, "Seller"), each a "Party" and collectively the "Parties,"  made this agreement (this "Agreement") effective as of the 1st Day of January, 2000 (the "Effective Date").  

ARTICLE 1. TERM  This Agreement shall be in effect from the commencement of the Gas Day on the Effective Date through the close of the Gas Day on December 31, 2002 (the "Primary Term"), and thereafter continue in effect from Month to Month, unless terminated by either Party upon written notice to the other Party given 30 Days prior to the end of the Primary Term or any Month thereafter.  All indemnity and confidentiality obligations and audit rights shall survive the termination or expiration hereof.

ARTICLE 2. CONTRACT PRICE  2.1. Price.  Buyer shall pay a price per MMBtu (in each case, the "Contract Price"), determined on a dry basis in accordance with Buyer's Procedures, for Gas delivered each Month, equal to 85 percent of the Houston Ship Channel/Beaumont, Texas Index for large packages of Gas as published in the first publication of the Month in Inside F.E.R.C. LESS $0.00, and LESS any and all costs and expenses of Buyer attributable to the compression, dehydration, gathering, transporting and other post production operations necessary to treat and transport the Gas for delivery into the pipeline system of Houston Pipe Line Company (collectively, the "Deduction"); provided, at the end of the Primary Term and thereafter, if the Parties have not then agreed to an extended Primary Term, each percentage of the referenced index on which the Contract Price is calculated shall be reduced by five percent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, should deliveries commence on any Day of a Month other than the first Day thereof, the Contract Price per MMBtu for Gas delivered during such partial Month shall be equal to 85 percent of the Gas Daily Price for Houston Ship Channel for each Gas Day in which deliveries occurred LESS $0.00 and LESS the Deduction.  If any referenced index is not available in the future, and the Parties do not agree to an alternate as of the end of the first Month for which the Contract Price could not be determined, then the determination of a replacement index shall be subject to arbitration.

2.2.  Extension.  It is the intent of the Parties to facilitate agreements by the Parties to one or more extensions of the Primary Term and the Contract Price applicable thereto (each, an "Extension") in accordance with the agreed procedures in this Section 2.2 and to assure that each Extension is valid and enforceable.  At the election of Buyer, any Extension may be formed (i) by a written amendment executed by the Parties or (ii) verbally whereby an offer and acceptance shall constitute the agreement of the Parties to an Extension.  The Parties shall be bound by each Extension from the time they agree to its terms pursuant hereto.  The Parties acknowledge that each Party will rely thereon in doing business related to the Extension.  In addition to, but not in lieu of, the foregoing, the Parties agree that Buyer may confirm a verbal Extension by providing Seller a Confirmation and that a reasonable time for the receipt by Seller of a Confirmation is within 30 Days of the Extension formation.  Buyer adopts its letterhead, including its address, as its signature on any Confirmation as the identification of Buyer and authentication by Buyer thereof, and such letterhead shall be sufficient to verify that Buyer originated the Confirmation.  The Parties agree that objections to the Confirmation shall be made in writing on or before 10 Days from the receipt thereof by Seller.  Upon issuance of a Confirmation and the passage of such 10 Days, if no objection to the Confirmation has been then received, the Confirmation shall be conclusive evidence of the Extension made the subject matter thereof and the final expression of all of its terms.  The Parties agree not to contest or assert a defense to the validity or enforceability of any verbal Extension entered into in accordance with this Agreement under laws relating to whether certain agreements are to be in writing or signed by the Party to be thereby bound or the authority of any employee of the Party.

Re:  Confidential Settlement and Release
       


Dear __________,

This follows up on our recent discussions about the above-referenced matter.  You advised that Rio Tinto had recently acquired North, Ltd.  Prior to that acquisition, North Ltd. had raised certain claims against Enron Metals.  Because Enron Metals greatly values its ongoing business relationship with Rio Tinto, and not in any way as an admission of fault or liability, Enron Metals wishes to settle any and all claims raised or that could have been raised to date by North Ltd., on the terms and conditions set forth below.

(Blue Grass) and Enron North America Corp. (ENA) (Blue Grass Coal Purchase Agreement) and Coal Purchase Agreement by and between Somerset SynFuel, L.P. (Somerset) and ENA (Somerset Coal Purchase Agreement)  (the Blue Grass Coal Purchase Agreement and the Somerset Coal Purchase Agreement collectively the "Coal Purchase Agreement")Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:	This notice is being provided to Blue Grass and Somerset pursuant to Article 10 of each Coal Purchase Agreement and to respond to a letter dated November 17, 2000, from your counsel, Deborah A. Gitomer, Esquire.	In Ms. Gitomer's letter Blue Grass and Somerset take the position that ENA is somehow required to supply coal fines and coal reject or gob under each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.  This is erroneous and contrary to the express language of each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.  Under each of the Coal Purchase Agreements, ENA is obligated to meet the coal Specifications and Sizing Requirements at the Delivery Point - the Belt Scale - not earlier as you now contend.  Your position flies in the face of Sections 1.1, 3.1, 4.1 and Schedule 4.1 of both Coal Purchase Agreements.	Pursuant to Section 3.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement, ENA is obligated to supply to Blue Grass and Somerset all "Coal Feedstock" required by each Facility and to maintain a minimum stockpile of 9,000 Tons of Coal Feedstock for each Facility.  "Coal Feedstock" is defined in Section 1.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement as follows:"coal feedstock and related materials which were separated from run of mine or similar coal during prior cleaning, screening  or preparation operations and which will be chemically combined at the Facility with a binder material in order to produce Synthetic Fuel; provided, however, in no event shall the term "Coal Feedstock" include any previously produced Synthetic Fuel."Under Section 4.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement, it is ENA's obligation to deliver Coal Feedstock at the Delivery Point, which is defined as the Belt Scale, which meets the specifications that are set forth on Schedule 4.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement.  Schedule 4.1 requires a size distribution at the Delivery Point ("Sizing Requirement") of: "Generally, 3/4 inch x 0 inch.  Sizing within a normal Bell curve with the apex of the curve occurring at approximately 1/4 inch."  	To date, all Coal Feedstock delivered to each Facility meets the requirements of each Coal Purchase Agreement in that the Coal Feedstock (i) is coal feedstock and related materials which were separated from run of mine or similar coal during prior cleaning, screening  or preparation operations and (ii) meets the Specifications when it is delivered to Blue Grass or Somerset.	In accordance with its obligations under each Coal Purchase Agreement, ENA has delivered to Pier IX, approximately thirty thousand (30,000) Tons of Coal Feedstock that will meet the Specifications and Sizing Requirements at the Delivery Point, as provided in each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.	Notwithstanding ENA's compliance with and performance of its obligations under each Coal Purchase Agreement, through your counsel, you have informed ENA that you have contracted to obtain coal from third party suppliers, who have no contractual relationship with either ENA, Blue Grass or Somerset.  Such purchases of coal are in violation of each of the Coal Purchase Agreements and constitute a material breach of each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.	Under Section 3.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement, ENA is the exclusive supplier of Coal Feedstock required by the Facility.	ENA has invested substantial sums in preparation for its performance under each of the Coal Purchase Agreements and stands ready, willing and able to perform all of its obligations thereunder.  ENA urges and requests that you also comply with the terms and conditions of each Coal Purchase Agreement and that Blue Grass and Somerset take immediate delivery of the Coal Feedstock that ENA is attempting to supply strictly in accordance with each Coal Supply Agreement.	Further, in light of Blue Grass's and Somerset's recent actions we also believe that it is necessary to call to your attention that neither Blue Grass or Somerset has any business relationship with Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. "C", other than the Deed of Lease by and between Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. "C", as lessor and Blue Grass SynFuel, L.L.C. as lessee and Deed of Lease by and between Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. "C", as lessor and Somerset SynFuel, L.P. as lessee.  As such, Blue Grass and Somerset have no power or authority to direct the actions of Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. "C" and should, and hereby are, directed to refrain from any and all such communications or directions with respect to this matter or any of the obligations of either ENA or Blue Grass or Somerset under each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.	While ENA is ready and willing to work with Blue Grass and Somerset to resolve this issue, ENA must insist that Blue Grass and Somerset comply with the terms of the Coal Purchase Agreement.							Very truly yours,							Enron North America Corp.											cc:	Blue Grass SynFuel, L.L.C.	c/o Sempra Energy Trading Corp.	58 Commerce Road	Stamford, Connecticut  06902	Attn: Richard C.

(Blue Grass) and Enron North America Corp. (ENA) (Blue Grass Coal Purchase Agreement) and Coal Purchase Agreement by and between Somerset SynFuel, L.P. (Somerset) and ENA (Somerset Coal Purchase Agreement)  (the Blue Grass Coal Purchase Agreement and the Somerset Coal Purchase Agreement collectively the "Coal Purchase Agreement")Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:	This notice is being provided to Blue Grass and Somerset pursuant to Article 10 of each Coal Purchase Agreement and to respond to a letter dated November 17, 2000, from your counsel, Deborah A. Gitomer, Esquire.	In Ms. Gitomer's letter Blue Grass and Somerset take the position that ENA is somehow required to supply coal fines and coal reject or gob under each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.  This is erroneous and contrary to the express language of each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.  Under each of the Coal Purchase Agreements, ENA is obligated to meet the coal Specifications and Sizing Requirements at the Delivery Point - the Belt Scale - not earlier as you now contend.  Your position flies in the face of Sections 1.1, 3.1, 4.1 and Schedule 4.1 of both Coal Purchase Agreements.	Pursuant to Section 3.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement, ENA is obligated to supply to Blue Grass and Somerset all "Coal Feedstock" required by each Facility and to maintain a minimum stockpile of 9,000 Tons of Coal Feedstock for each Facility.  "Coal Feedstock" is defined in Section 1.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement as follows:"coal feedstock and related materials which were separated from run of mine or similar coal during prior cleaning, screening  or preparation operations and which will be chemically combined at the Facility with a binder material in order to produce Synthetic Fuel; provided, however, in no event shall the term "Coal Feedstock" include any previously produced Synthetic Fuel."Under Section 4.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement, it is ENA's obligation to deliver Coal Feedstock at the Delivery Point, which is defined as the Belt Scale, which meets the specifications that are set forth on Schedule 4.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement.  Schedule 4.1 requires a size distribution at the Delivery Point ("Sizing Requirement") of: "Generally, 3/4 inch x 0 inch.  Sizing within a normal Bell curve with the apex of the curve occurring at approximately 1/4 inch."  	To date, all Coal Feedstock delivered to each Facility meets the requirements of each Coal Purchase Agreement in that the Coal Feedstock (i) is coal feedstock and related materials which were separated from run of mine or similar coal during prior cleaning, screening  or preparation operations and (ii) meets the Specifications when it is delivered to Blue Grass or Somerset.	In accordance with its obligations under each Coal Purchase Agreement, ENA has delivered to Pier IX, approximately thirty thousand (30,000) Tons of Coal Feedstock that will meet the Specifications and Sizing Requirements at the Delivery Point, as provided in each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.	Notwithstanding ENA's compliance with and performance of its obligations under each Coal Purchase Agreement, through your counsel, you have informed ENA that you have contracted to obtain coal from third party suppliers, who have no contractual relationship with either ENA, Blue Grass or Somerset.  Such purchases of coal are in violation of each of the Coal Purchase Agreements and constitute a material breach of each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.	Under Section 3.1 of each Coal Purchase Agreement, ENA is the exclusive supplier of Coal Feedstock required by the Facility.	ENA has invested substantial sums in preparation for its performance under each of the Coal Purchase Agreements and stands ready, willing and able to perform all of its obligations thereunder.  ENA urges and requests that you also comply with the terms and conditions of each Coal Purchase Agreement and that Blue Grass and Somerset take immediate delivery of the Coal Feedstock that ENA is attempting to supply strictly in accordance with each Coal Supply Agreement.	Further, in light of Blue Grass's and Somerset's recent actions we also believe that it is necessary to call to your attention that neither Blue Grass or Somerset has any business relationship with Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. "C", other than the Deed of Lease by and between Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. "C", as lessor and Blue Grass SynFuel, L.L.C. as lessee and Deed of Lease by and between Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. "C", as lessor and Somerset SynFuel, L.P. as lessee.  As such, Blue Grass and Somerset have no power or authority to direct the actions of Kinder Morgan Operating L.P. "C" and should, and hereby are, directed to refrain from any and all such communications or directions with respect to this matter or any of the obligations of either ENA or Blue Grass or Somerset under each of the Coal Purchase Agreements.	While ENA is ready and willing to work with Blue Grass and Somerset to resolve this issue, ENA must insist that Blue Grass and Somerset comply with the terms of the Coal Purchase Agreement.							Very truly yours,							Enron North America Corp.											cc:	Blue Grass SynFuel, L.L.C.	c/o Sempra Energy Trading Corp.	58 Commerce Road	Stamford, Connecticut  06902	Attn: Richard C.

CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE/ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT


This memorandum summarizes some of the trading strategies that the traders are using in the Cal PX and CAISO markets.  Each of these strategies is identified by the traders’ nickname for it. 

“Load Shift”

The profits here are earned by shifting load from a congested zone to a less congested zone, thereby earning payments for reducing congestion (unused FTRs).

The numbers presented do not reconcile with the net earnings numbers listed on our web cite or the audited net earnings included in Enron Corp.’s 10Q information provided to the PUC.  Commenters have attached a spreadsheet showing Enron Corp.’s actual net earning for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  

Even as corrected, the problem with the net earnings shown is that they do not reflect simply Enron Corp.’s electricity business in California.  Instead they are Enron Corp.’s net earnings across all of its businesses including global wholesale energy commodities, services, contract portfolio management, assets and investments; retail energy services; pipeline transmission and distribution; oil and gas production, and broadband services.   Commenters don’t keep records showing the portion of Enron Corp.’s net earnings that are attributable to California electric operations.  Moreover, the increase in the earnings levels from 1999 to 2000 do not show that Commenters rates were not unjust and unreasonable because this level of increase is significantly less than the increase in the level of earnings from 1998 to 1999 (61 percent as compared to 106 percent).  

Commenter’s rates during this period were as a matter of law, just and reasonable, given that their rates were at negotiated levels consistent with their market based rate authority, below the caps required by the FERC for the California ISO, and established  pursuant to the one-price auction mechanism established by the ISO’s and PX’s tariff.  Moreover, as we pointed out in our FERC comments beginning at page 19, it would be inequitable to impose one-way refunds – requiring sellers to bailout the UDCs when UDC’s purchasing decisions prove wrong but not in turn bailing out sellers when the market moves against them.  In the open market, parties mitigate their risk through forward purchases and financial instruments, not refunds.

 I have known both Michael Beatty and Charles Renfrew for a substantial period of time.  In my opinion, they are both outstanding lawyers and I hold them in high regard.

 Approximately 10 or more years ago, my firm was involved in litigation and represented ANR and CIG.  I was personally only tangentially involved in those matters but it was through that representation that I became acquainted with Michael Beatty.  I was also asked to sit as a neutral advisor on one occasion and to hear arguments being advanced by Michael Beatty’s client and to also hear the arguments being advanced by the opposing party and to then express my opinion concerning the merits or lack of merits of each side.  I have seen him from time to time at the 10th Circuit Judicial Conference but in recent times I have not had occasion to see him or work with him.

 Charles Renfrew was the former Director of Law at Chevron.  In that same general time frame, I was Vice President and General Counsel of Shell.  We both were members of the Association of General Counsel and I would see him from time to time at those meetings.  In the lat 8 - 10 years, we both have been active in alternative dispute resolution work and about 3 or 4 years ago, we were on an arbitration panel together in a dispute between health service providers.  The decision of the panel was unanimous.  About 2 or 3 years ago, I was an expert witness before an arbitration panel which was dealing with the question concerning the allowance of attorneys fees.  Charles Renfrew was a member of that panel.

 From my point of view, there is nothing in my professional or personal relationship with either Michael Beatty or Charles Renfrew which would impinge upon my neutrality or independence should I be selected as a neutral Chairman of the panel.

 I am honored to be considered.

History and Introduction to Electricity Restructuring
A good deal of misinformation and often misrepresentation of the facts about the deregulation of California’s generation markets has been put forth.  What follows is an attempt to refute some of the more common myths and misconceptions.  These will be updated on a regular basis as new issues surface.  First, a brief history: 
Deregulation of wholesale electricity in California was first proposed by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in April of 1994 with the release of the so-called “Blue Book.”  Although the CPUC had introduced deregulation concepts as policy alternatives a year earlier, the specific proposals in the Blue Book went far beyond those earlier ideas and were poorly conceived.  As a result, the value of Edison stock, and that of the other investor-owned California electric utilities, dropped by more than 40 percent. 
SCE opposed the Blue Book proposal, arguing that there was no need to fix an electric supply system that wasn’t broken.  However, over the next year and a half, pressure by regulators, independent generators and the large industrial and commercial businesses for deregulation continued to grow.  SCE was encouraged by state policymakers to take a leadership role in forging a compromise proposal.  SCE worked with consumer groups and independent generators, and in the fall of 1995, offered a deregulation plan to the CPUC and state Legislature.  The CPUC considered this proposal along with others, but did not adopt it when it issued its Preferred Policy Decision in December 1995.  Subsequently, the legislature took up the issue and in the summer of 1996, passed legislation unanimously in both houses, — AB1890 — which had broad support from customers, utilities, labor and environmentalists, et. al.  Key to the agreed-upon legislation was the assurance that investors in utilities — primarily older individuals looking for retirement security, would have a fair opportunity to fully recover their investments in California’s electricity portfolio which had been approved by prior regulatory decisions of the CPUC.  
Residential customers received a 10 percent rate reduction during this period of transition, which was scheduled to end the earlier of Dec. 31, 2001, or when costs incurred for the state’s benefit were fully recovered.  The law required that Edison divest at least 50 percent of the generation portfolio it owned in the Los Angeles basin.  Regulators and legislators encouraged SCE to sell all of those plants.  Edison was also required to sell all of the electricity generated by its remaining generation plants into the state wholesale market, the Power Exchange (PX), and purchase all of its electricity requirements for its customers from the PX. 
The actual implementation of the law was left primarily to the CPUC, and the prices in the wholesale market were set according to market rules developed by the Independent System Operator (ISO) and California Power Exchange (CalPX), entities under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  The implementation of deregulation by these bodies was seriously flawed. 
 Beginning in May 2000, prices in the wholesale market were no longer workably competitive.  Although many factors were responsible, key to the failure of the market was the requirement by the CPUC that the state’s investor-owned utilities purchase all of their electricity in the CalPX day ahead, or so-called, spot market.  In effect, utilities were “short” for the electricity required to serve more than 20 million people and the California economy everyday.  And the CalPX rules set the price for all energy purchased at the highest price bid in the spot markets.

Let’s Get It Straight
Question: Edison received $9 billion dollars as part of deregulation.  Where is that money?  Why isn’t some of that money being used to get the company out of debt? 
Answer:
It’s misleading to look at the total revenues received by Edison under deregulation without looking at the sources of those revenues and what they were used for.  Under deregulation law and CPUC rules, Edison receives revenues from ratepayers, from the sales of its generation plants, and from sales of its generation output into the Independent System Operator and California Power Exchange markets.  The PUC and state law specify how these revenues are to be used.  
Revenues from customers are used to pay for transmission and distribution, public goods programs designated by the state, and procurement of electricity from the ISO and PX markets.  To the extent that there are revenues left over, these funds are used to pay the costs of utility generation obligations required under regulation.  For Edison, 90% of these revenues were used to pay for uneconomic contracts with independent generators or Qualifying Facilities (wind, solar, biomass and geothermal) that were mandated by the state.  
Revenues from the sales of Edison’s generation plants are used first to retire debt associated with those plants, to return to shareholders their investment in those plants, and then to reduce the ratepayers’ statutory obligation to pay certain transition costs designated by law.  Revenues from the sales of the output of Edison generation are first used to cover operating costs, and then used to reduce the ratepayers’ statutory obligation to pay certain transition costs designated by law. 
Edison also received $2.4 billion from the sale of rate reduction bonds.  As their name implies, these bonds were used to fund the 10% rate reduction provided to residential and small commercial customers.  The Legislature provided for the mechanism to fund this reduction through the sales of these bonds.  The revenues from the bonds compensate Edison for the reduction in revenue resulting from the 10% rate reduction.  Edison took the cash received from the sale of these bonds and used it to retire debt and equity that is to pay off loans and to buy back shares of stock.  Edison used the funds in this way because the CPUC requires that Edison retain a balanced capital structure.

Default Invoice Communication to Participants 


Southern California Edison has defaulted in the PX’s December 2000 Day-Ahead/Day-Of Invoice, issued 9 January 2001.  Payments were due in to the PX by noon on Thursday, January 18, 2001. Schedule 2, Section 5.3 of the PX Tariff, “PX Core Market Proportional Charge-Back Methodology” stipulates:
 
The PX Participant’s outstanding default amount will be charged back to all current PX Participants based upon the percentage of its gross sales in MWhs to the total gross MWhs sales in the Core market during the three calendar months preceding the event plus the current month-to-date.

The PX is, accordingly, issuing a supplemental invoice to all participants, reflecting their share of the default amount based on their percentage of gross sales.  Participants whose aggregated cash amounts, net of both invoices, result in monies owed TO THE PX should complete their payments by noon, Monday, 22 January 2001.  The PX will send to each participant a statement summarizing their invoices and cash positions and a file that reflects the gross sales calculations and the default shares.

Re:       Deposition of Rajiv Patel

  The deposition of Rajiv Patel continued today, with NatWest’s counsel still asking the questions.
  Schiffman painstakingly established every written document that Patel considered, and every oral communication that he had, before Farallon decided to invest—no docs from Enron, no oral communications with Enron.  A lot of the testimony was repetitious from the first day.

STATEMENT OF PUC COMMISSIONER LORETTA LYNCH



On December 21, 2000, the California Public Utilities Commission issued an order stating its intent to conduct independent audits of Southern California Edison’s and Pacific Gas & Electric Company’s financial circumstances. 
 
On December 26, 2000, KPMG and the Barrington-Wellesley Group commenced immediate review of the financial condition of Southern California Edison Company and Pacific Gas & Electric Company.  These auditors took on an extraordinary task – reviewing the books of the utilities as well as their parent companies in an abbreviated time frame, as full audits of multiple corporate entities usually require six months or more to complete.  I commend KPMG and BWG for providing this audit in an extraordinary time frame – one month after beginning the work.  
 
The factual data underlying the analyses of the auditors has been provided to the utilities in advance to identify any confidentiality concerns.  Southern California Edison Company has agreed to make the underlying data public.  PG&E raised several objections to the release of the underlying data, primarily with respect to facts involving their affiliates.  By the attached Assigned Commissioner Ruling, I have overruled PG&E’s confidentiality objections based on the overriding public interest in this information, and hereby release it publicly.  The attached narrative is comprised of the auditors’ analysis, based upon the underlying data as reflected in the tables and exhibits attached to the audits.

  The documents read or available to Farallon were the undated “pink” (Ex 1549), the red herring dated February 9 (?), 1998 (or undated?) (Ex 43), the supp to the red herring dated February 27, 1998 (Ex 402), the final offering memorandum dated March 2, 1998 (Ex 52), the supp to the final offering memorandum dated 3/12/98 (Ex. __), the first road show slides (Ex  1632), the second road show slides (Ex 1637), and the “draft” Marcus report (Ex 1633)  (collectively, the “Offering Documents.”).

Re:       Continuing Deposition of Rajiv Patel

  The deposition of Rajiv Patel continued today.  I asked questions for about two hours.  The rest of the day was taken up by questions by counsel for PaineWebber.  I stayed for only a portion of these questions.
  Throughout the first four days of his deposition, Patel was appealing, firm, thorough, and strong.  He is very smart and extremely well prepared.  Defense counsel collectively believe that Patel is the best plaintiff’s witness in all of the NSM cases.

In today's reponse to CDWR's RFP, Enron submitted four "concepts" for DWR's consideration.  A few preliminary points:


All prices submitted are indicative and subject to change.  
There are still significant concerns about credit risk.
The language in the legislation authorizing DWR to purchase power is very unclear regarding the rate mechanism that will be used to recover DWR’s power purchase costs from ratepayers.
Equally important, it is very unclear whether DWR has the jurisdiction to impose on ratepayers the charges necessary to recover its costs.  The CPUC remains the state authority vested with ratemaking authority.  That authority derives from the State Constitution.
In short, there could be a conflict between the PUC and DWR and it is unclear that DWR would prevail.
To remedy the credit risk issue, the proposal offers the option of collateral, letter of credit, or other comparable means for each of the offers made.

Re:       Deposition of William Mellin

  The deposition of William Mellin, a partner of Farallon Capital Partners, commenced today in San Francisco.  Mellin is Rajiv Patel’s boss and is the individual at Farallon responsible for Farallon’s decisions to invest in NSM’s senior subordinated notes.
Mellin is very clean cut and preppy looking.  He is very well prepared, but he is not as confident, persuasive, or likeable as Patel.  He is reluctant to make any concessions, even on obvious points.

Re:       Deposition of William Mellin

  The deposition of William Mellin of Farallon Capital Partners continued today in San Francisco.  The questioner all day was Kevin Murphy of Dickstein, Shapiro, NatWest’s counsel. 
Mellin presented himself similarly as the day before, except that his insistence on the most extreme positions made him appear, at least to me, rather disingenuous.  He appeared to make up far more definite and precise representations than the record would indicate.  For example, he insisted that the apparent risks in the transaction were not risks at all.  He insisted that he was told that the Management Company would make sure that no related party transactions ever occurred again.

Dear Mr. Sladoje:

On Monday February 5, 2001, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. ("DETM") was informed by _________________ [insert name of person who called DETM] on behalf  of the California Power Exchange ("PX") that, due to the commandeering by the State of California of the block forward contracts ("BF Contracts") of Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") and Pacific Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E"), the PX would no longer be able to perform any of its obligations under the PX FERC Rate Schedule No. 1 ("CTS Tariff") or the applicable Participation Agreements as they relate to the BF Contracts, including its obligations to schedule power and perform settlement or other functions.

 As a result of these and other actions that have been taken by the PX, some of which were outlined in our January 30, 2001 letter to you, it is DETM's position that it has no legal obligation to continue to perform under the BF Contracts.  Moreover, given the communications received by DETM from the PX on February 5th, continued performance by DETM under the BF Contracts is not possible.  Accordingly,  unless we receive scheduling instructions from the PX and confirmation from the PX that it will perform its obligations under the CTS Tariff and the applicable Participation Agreements, in each case prior to 10:00 a.m. PST on Tuesday, February 6,  DETM will not be able to continue scheduling power under the BF Contracts with the ISO as it has been doing on a voluntary basis since January 31, 2001.

DETM does not intend by this letter to waive any rights it may have with respect to the BF Contracts or to preclude any actions it may be entitled to take in any forum against the PX or any other party.

We shall presume, unless we receive instructions from you as indicated above  that the PX does not dispute our understanding, as outlined in this letter, of the PX's ability and willingness to continue performing its obligations with respect to the BF Contracts.

Dear Mr. Sladoje:

On Monday February 5, 2001, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. ("DETM") was informed by _________________ [insert name of person who called DETM] on behalf  of the California Power Exchange ("PX") that, due to the commandeering by the State of California of the block forward contracts ("BF Contracts") of Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") and Pacific Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E"), the PX would no longer be able to perform any of its obligations under the PX FERC Rate Schedule No. 1 ("CTS Tariff") or the applicable Participation Agreements as they relate to the BF Contracts, including its obligations to schedule power and perform settlement or other functions.

 As a result of these and other actions that have been taken by the PX, some of which were outlined in our January 30, 2001 letter to you, it is DETM's position that it has no legal obligation to continue to perform under the BF Contracts.  Moreover, given the communications received by DETM from the PX on February 5th, continued performance by DETM under the BF Contracts is not possible.  Accordingly,  unless we receive scheduling instructions from the PX and confirmation from the PX that it will perform its obligations under the CTS Tariff and the applicable Participation Agreements, in each case prior to 10:00 a.m. PST on Tuesday, February 6,  DETM will not be able to continue scheduling power under the BF Contracts with the ISO as it has been doing on a voluntary basis since January 31, 2001.

DETM does not intend by this letter to waive any rights it may have with respect to the BF Contracts or to preclude any actions it may be entitled to take in any forum against the PX or any other party.

We shall presume, unless we receive instructions from you as indicated above  that the PX does not dispute our understanding, as outlined in this letter, of the PX's ability and willingness to continue performing its obligations with respect to the BF Contracts.

Ventureline

1) How large is the fund and how large does Enron want it be? I read a 1999 article that said Enron hopes to fund grows to $50m in three years. Is that right?  Who is investing in the fund and has it been difficult getting investors? Wells Fargo was one of the first investors, right? How many others have signed on?
The Fund has closed on $15 million in addition to the initial $20 million committed by Enron.  We anticipate a second and final closing this month to top the Fund out at approximately $40 million.  Our investors include Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America, and Washington Mutual; one to two other banks have expressed strong interest in investing.

2) How many and what types of companies have the fund invested in? Are you looking only for Houston-based companies? I read where Mr. Humphrey said the fund's average investment would be $2M to $3M and the most it will invest in any one co. is $5M. Is that still the case?
To date the Fund has invested approximately $15 million in 13 deals.  The purpose of the Fund is to invest in Houston-based companies, but there is a 20% carve-out for deals outside of Houston.  Thus far, the portfolio companies have varied from small restaurant to high-tech Internet software plays.  Deals range in size from $100,000 to $4,000,000 -- and that is probably our max.

3) Furthermore, can you confirm that the fund is looking for a return of 18% to 20% from its investments?  Those are good returns. Nevertheless, is the fund's main goal community development?
The Fund expects a cash-on-cash return of 18-20%, or an IRR of 25-35%.

Note: This letter was drafted by Enron Canada and sent to Dr. West.  It was not on Enron letterhead as it was intended to be signed in counterpart by other marketers.  It was circulated to a number of companies that had expressed interest in participating in the PPA auction process and we were advised by Aquila, Duke, TransCanada Energy, Enmax, PG&E, and Encore Energy that they each executed a copy of the letter in counterpart form and sent it to Dr. West within a day or two of Enron Canada doing so.

Re:      Enron Indemnification Claim
Date:   August 4, 2000
  Following our conference call, I believe these are the relevant facts:
On March 2, 1998, ECT Securities Corp. ("ECTSC"), a Delaware corporation, along with three other parties (together with ECTSC, the "Purchasers"), entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Nakornthai Strip Mill Public Company Limited ("NSM"), a Thai corporation, and two of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (the "Note Issuers" and, together with NSM, the "Issuers"), whereby the Note Issuers agreed to issue and sell to the Purchasers, and the Purchasers agreed to buy from the Note Issuers, $249,000,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity of 12% Senior Mortgage Notes Due 2006 guaranteed by NSM (the "Senior Notes"), and 203,500,000 units consisting in the aggregate of $203,500,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity of 12 ¼% Senior Subordinated Mortgage Notes Due 2008 guaranteed by NSM (the "Senior Subordinated Notes") and warrants to purchase 128,834,356 ordinary shares, par value 10 Baht per share, of NSM (the "Warrants" and, together with the Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes, the "NSM Securities").  See Section 1 of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which has been supplied to you.
  In the Purchase Agreement the Issuers, including NSM, jointly and severally, (i) represented that certain documents prepared by the Issuers for use by the Purchasers in reselling any of the NSM Securities (collectively the "Offering Document") were true and complete (See Purchase Agreement, Section 2(a)) and (ii) indemnified each of the Purchasers, including ECTSC, from any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (including legal expenses), arising out of any untrue statement in, or material omission from, the Offering Document (except for information supplied by the Purchasers).  See Purchase Agreement, Section 7.
  Of the NSM Securities purchased by ECTSC, ECTSC retained for its own account 11,750 units, consisting of $11,750,000 principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes and warrants to purchase 7,438,839 shares of NSM .

BACKGROUND



The Canadian Competition Bureau has initiated an investigation of certain transactions involving Enron and Powerex during the period from June to October of 1999.
Apparently on referral from the Power Pool of Alberta, the Bureau is investigating whether Enron and Powerex colluded or engaged in “bid rigging” in certain power sales into the Alberta Power Pool.
The Bureau sent investigators to Enron’s Calgary office and Powerex’s office for several days at the end of May 2000.  Enron and Powerex did complete certain purchase and sale transactions during this period wherein Enron purchased power from Powerex and, on most occasions, was able to sell power into the Power Pool at a price higher than what it paid Powerex.  It appears that for 22 hours during this 5 month period Enron’s offers cleared the Power Pool’s merit order and were therefore accepted by the Pool.  It also appears that for 16 of those 22 hours, Enron’s offers established the market clearing price for the hour or some part of the hour.  
The Power Pool of Alberta has a price cap of CDN $1,000/MWh.  Enron’s market clearing sales ranged from less than CDN $100/MWh to as high as CDN $998/MWh.

OUTLINE OF ANALYSIS

 Damages for repudiation under UCC

UCC §2-719(1)

The UCC expressly permits the parties to agree to contractual remedies in addition to those provided by the UCC.
A court is likely to treat the buy-out provisions of Section 11.02 of the PPA as a remedy available to the Project if Brazos repudiates because any other treatment would allow Brazos to circumvent the clear agreement of the parties as to the “cost” to Brazos of getting out of the PPA.
The view is clearly supported by the decisions of the courts.
Examples: Prenalta Corporation v. Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 944 F.2d 677 (10th Cir. 1991)

Background for Meeting w/Craven Crowell/TVA


Enron signed a Master Power Agreement (MOPA) with TVA in late 1995.  The contract afforded TVA the option to purchase power from Enron pursuant to terms and conditions described in the contract.  The MOPA contract also sets the price for power delivered to TVA and requires EPMI to deliver energy to TVA at selected Permitted Delivery Points (PDP).  The PDPs are all interface points between TVA’s system and those of other interconnecting utilities.  During the execution of the MOPA, EPMI was often unable to deliver power to the PDP’s because of inadequate available transmission capability (ATC).  

EPMI contended (and still contends) that the MOPA allocated to TVA the risk of non-delivery as a result of insufficient ATC at the PDPs.  TVA claimed EPMI was breaching its obligations.  The legal dispute, which is currently pending and outlined below, ensued:

Enron Power Marketing, Inc. v. Tennessee Valley Authority
(Tennessee Federal District Court) 
· EPMI filed a declaratory judgment action against TVA in Chattanooga, Tennessee, requesting that the court hold that EPMI can satisfy its delivery obligation to TVA by delivering energy to an inter-connecting utility.

LETTER TO JERREL BRANSON (MAILED TO HIS HOUSE IN WYOMING – WILL NEED ADDRESS)


Dear Jerrel:

 On August 10, 2000 I ran across some documents that show your involvement in setting up a South American company called Ecogas S.A.  That same day I called you to inquire about the details of Ecogas S.A.  In our telephone conversation, you explicitly denied any involvement as well as any ownership for you, Martin Panelo, Jose Antonio Magalhaes Lins, Jose Caetano Lacerda, or a company named Tortola Consultoria e Servicios, Ltda.  You also stated that any such venture would be for the direct benefit of Ecogas Corp.  During that same telephone conversation I asked you to forward any and all correspondence, documents, Articles of Incorporation, etc… regarding Ecogas S.A.  On August 14 I received a package of incomplete information including a DRAFT Memorandum of Understanding.  Again, I am requesting copies of all relevant documents, agreements, articles of incorporation, bylaws, etc… as well as definitive written answers to the following questions:


Who is Ecogas S.A.?
Who are the beneficial owners and what percentage of Ecogas S.A. do they own?

BACKGROUND



The Canadian Competition Bureau has initiated an investigation of certain transactions involving Enron and Powerex during the period from June to October of 1999.
Apparently on referral from the Power Pool of Alberta, the Bureau is investigating whether Enron and Powerex colluded or engaged in “bid rigging” in certain power sales into the Alberta Power Pool.
The Bureau sent investigators to Enron’s Calgary office and Powerex’s office for several days at the end of May 2000.  Enron and Powerex did complete certain purchase and sale transactions during this period wherein Enron purchased power from Powerex and, on most occasions, was able to sell power into the Power Pool at a price higher than what it paid Powerex.  It appears that for 22 hours during this 5 month period Enron’s offers cleared the Power Pool’s merit order and were therefore accepted by the Pool.  It also appears that for 16 of those 22 hours, Enron’s offers established the market clearing price for the hour or some part of the hour.  
The Power Pool of Alberta has a price cap of CDN $1,000/MWh.  Enron’s market clearing sales ranged from less than CDN $100/MWh to as high as CDN $998/MWh.

Fixing What Is Broken: What Steps Should FERC Take to Complete California’s Power Markets?

A Summary of Fixing What is Broken:  What Steps Should FERC Take to Complete California’s Power Markets?


Introduction
Market information is essential to the efficient operation of the market.
The ISO cannot be effective as a market institution because its governance is dominated by market participants. 
Policy decisions have greatly limited the number of buyers of electricity, and have unduly constrained the manner of their participation in the marketplace.
Demand price signals are nearly absent from the wholesale market.
The market structure has prevented risks from being managed efficiently, and has instead allocated them all to customers and all purchases and sales have been forced through this market, to the detriment of efficiency and customers.
Finally, in a real market, prices reflect scarcity where it exists.

AGREEMENT TO EXTEND SECOND INTERIM AGREEMENT
AND WAIVER REGARDING INCREMENTAL CAPACITY
FROM THE TENASKA CLEBURNE PLANT

[Q:  Does this action require bank consent?]

This Agreement (the "Agreement") is made as of the _______ day of October, 2000, by and between BRAZOS ELECTRIC POWER COOPERATIVE, INC. ("Brazos Electric"), having an office at 2404 LaSalle Avenue, Waco, Texas 76706, TENASKA IV TEXAS PARTNERS, Ltd., (“Tenaska”) having an office at 89 Headquarters Plaza, North Tower, 14th Floor, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, PONDEROSA PINE ENERGY, LLC, (“PPE”), having an office at 89 Headquarters Plaza, North Tower, 14th Floor, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, ECT MERCHANT INVESTMENTS CORP. (“ECTMI”), having an office at 1400 Smith, Houston, Texas 77002, and ENRON NORTH AMERICA (“ENA”) having an office at 1400 Smith, Houston, Texas 77002 (each of the foregoing referred to individually as "Party" or collectively as the "Parties");  [Q:  The original intent of this agreement was to extend the terms for selling incremental capacity and energy (5 MW) under the “Second Interim Agreement and Waiver” to the PPA.  The PPA is between Tenaska IV and Brazos Electric.  Does it make sense for this agreement to (1) address the preservation of rights to challenge the PPA and Cornhusker transaction and/or (2) involve other parties beyond Tenaska IV and Brazos?]

R E C I T A L S:
WHEREAS, Brazos Electric and Tenaska are parties to a certain Purchase Power Agreement dated November 1, 1993, as thereafter amended from time to time (“PPA”);

Subject: California ISO Price Caps

 Re: Transwestern v. El Paso/Undermeasurement Claim

Dear Mr. ____________:  

 This is a follow-up to our telephone conversation.  As I understand the facts, Transwestern has over-delivered approximately 1 Bcf of gas as a result of faulty metering by El Paso at the interconnect near Blanco, New Mexico.  This faulty metering caused undermeasurement of the gas delivered by Transwestern at the interconnect during the period from September 1996 through February 2000.  A routine audit was conducted in August 1997.  It revealed the undermeasurement and that it was caused by El Paso’s failure to follow the manufacturer’s recommended procedures regarding its metering equipment.  This was discussed with El Paso.  Again, in September 1999 another audit was conducted revealing a continuation of the underdeliveries and of El Paso’s failure to comply with the manufacturer’s procedures.

This letter could have negative ramifications. However, we should send it if 
El Paso mismeasured the gas. What happened to the conference call?

RE: Intrust USA 
Date: August 5, 1999
Yesterday, August 4, 1999, in our capacity as the sole Regular Limited Partner of the Houston Economic Opportunity Fund, L.P. we asked for the resignation of Intrust as a General Partner of the fund.  Our decision was based on several factors including the conflicts created by Intrust’s investing in transactions that it is also recommending to the fund and by the simultaneous marketing of a similar fund to the same parties with whom we are talking.
The process for the removal of a general partner requires a fifteen day period of negotiation related to the value of the general partner’s interest.  After fifteen days, if the parties can not agree on a value, then an arbitrator is identified to value the holdings.  Intrust will have the option of taking a cash payment or exchanging there general partner interest for an equal limited partner interest.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED

Dabhol Power Company
Dispute with United India

Arbitration proceedings are underway between DPC and United India in relation to DPC’s delay in start-up claim. It is very likely that these proceedings relate both to quantum and liability. Nevertheless, United India recently commenced English court proceedings against DPC in relation to liability in respect of the delay in start-up claim. Accordingly, DPC must decide whether to submit to the English court’s jurisdiction in respect of liability (i.e. to defend the Court proceedings) or to challenge the English court’s jurisdiction. A decision must be made by 12 January 2001 (the last date for filing an acknowledgement of service). The purpose of this paper is provide “headline” summaries of the factors relevant to that decision.
Factors in Favour of Litigating Liability

Litigation may be quicker and cheaper than arbitration.

This memorandum summarizes some of the trading strategies that the traders are using in the Cal PX and CAISO markets.  Each of these strategies is identified by the traders’ nickname for it. 

“Load Shift”

The profits here are earned by shifting load from a congested zone to a less congested zone, thereby earning payments for reducing congestion (unused FTRs).

Affidavit of G. Alan Comnes



Q. Please state your name, affiliation, and address.
A. I am G. Alan Comnes, Director, Government Affairs for Enron Corp.  My address is 121 SW Salmon 3WTC0306, Portland, Oregon 97204.

Q. Please describe your education and professional experience. 
A. I  have a B.S. in Science, Technology, and Society from Stanford University and a M.A. in  Energy and Resources from the  University of California at Berkeley.  From 1987-1992 I was a regulatory analyst at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). There I sponsored testimony on the topics of electric revenue allocation, natural gas rate design, marginal cost estimation, and fuel price forecasting.  I also worked in the CPUC’s Strategic Planning Division where I developed CPUC policies on transmission access and on proposed utility mergers.  From 1993-1995, I was a Scientific/Engineering Associate at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where I conducted research on the topics of wholesale electric power markets, incentive regulation, and demand side management.  From January 1996 through October 2000, I was an analysts for the consulting firm of  MRW & Associates, Inc. As part of my consulting practice, I have analyzed FERC-approved transmission and ISO tariffs, proposals for market-based rate authority, generation project development proposals, proposed utility mergers, and retail energy utility rate unbundling proposals.   I assumed my present position at Enron November 2000.

Analysis of Market Power Study
Prepared by Paul Joskow and Edward P. Kahn

Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") appended to its comments a market power study prepared by Paul Joskow and Edward P. Kahn, "A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior In California’s Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer 2000," Exhibit A (hereinafter referred to as "Joskow and Kahn Study").  Joskow and Kahn conclude, among other things, that sellers of electricity exercised market power in California last summer on the ground that prices of competitive wholesale market benchmark prices.  Joskow and Kahn's conclusions should be discarded because their analysis is riddled with conceptual and methodological flaws.

Although the Study claims to verify previous studies using publicly-available data (e.g., Borenstein Bushnell, and Wolak), it fails to address the criticisms that have been made of those studies.  Specifically, the Joskow and Kahn Study, at 6, purports to estimate a "competitive benchmark price" using a simplified dispatch model of California fossil generation to meet load after accounting for imports, in-state hydro generation, must-take generation and geothermal generation.  The incremental variable cost of the last generator dispatched to meet load becomes the "marginal cost."  This analysis is flawed in a number of respects:

 • Load in each month is modeled at only 10 representative "slices."  Market clearing prices are based on the marginal variable cost estimated to meet each load slice, scaled for ancillary services.  This load slice method treats each load level as a separate event and presumes that the same resource stack is available to supply each load slice.  This approach ignores the impact that energy-limited resources (hydro, pumped storage), who choose which time periods to sell into, have on marginal variable costs.  See Comnes Affidavit at 25.  This choice of time periods, fundamentally an opportunity cost analysis on the part of the supplier, is totally ignored in the Joskow and Kahn Study.

 • Supply-side dispatch is overly simplified.  In particular, there is no representation of the effect of forced outages other than a simple deration of capacity.  Planned or maintenance outages are allocated to "low load" months.  Such outages are now a matter of record; thus, the reliance by Joskow and Kahn on these assumptions rather than actual data may lead to highly inaccurate conclusions.

NOTE


Preface

Environmental laws enacted in India can be classified into broadly stated two categories. Prior to the “Bhopal Gas Leak Case”, otherwise known as the “Union Carbide Case”, the legislation in India was broadly in term of general law and there was nothing to distinguish it as specifically designed to improve or control environmental pollution. Post the “Bhopal Gas Leak Case” in December 1984, India has had a spate of “environmental legislation” aimed at controlling and improving the environment, including measures to combat environmental pollution. 
This Note does not claim to be an examination of the former legislation such as the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the Forest Act, 1927, the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This Note examines the provisions of relevant Acts such as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 [hereinafter referred to as “the Water Pollution Act”], the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991 and the National Environment Tribunal Act, 1995. The examination of the aforesaid provisions is not in the light of any factual matrix. The attempt in this Note has been to set out with amplification, where necessary,, the relevant provisions of environmental legislation.

Naphtha Leakage of Storage Tank – Notification to MPCB 


March 22, 2001

Draft Statement

I can confirm that on March 19, 2001, a filtration valve connected to a small storage tank malfunctioned and discharged a small quantity of naphtha.  A few minutes after its detection, the discharge was contained and the flow of naphtha to the valve was immediately stopped. The discharged naphtha extended only a short distance from the valve and clean up of the discharge commenced immediately after detection to mitigate any potential impact the discharge may have on the environment.

REMOVAL OF THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY SALES 
CLASS ACTIONS BASED ON FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION

The two complaints that have been filed so far (Gordon and Hendricks) seek to recover, under the Cartwright Act and other California statutes, alleged overcharges by the defendant wholesalers to California utilities which were passed on to consumers.  The alleged wrongdoing consists in substance of an alleged conspiracy to fix prices and restrict the supply of electricity.  
Under the Federal Power Act, any wholesale rate, such as those which plaintiffs challenge, is unlawful if it is not “just and reasonable” under the Act’s criteria.  There is exclusive federal jurisdiction (assigned to FERC, subject to Court of Appeals review) to determine whether wholesale power rates are just and reasonable.  Sections 205 and 206, 16 U.S.C. §§ 824d, 824e; see, e.g., Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U.S. 571, 577 (1981) (“Arkla”).  Unless and until there is a negative determination by FERC, the wholesale supplier must charge the rates specified in its approved or accepted tariffs, and under the filed rate doctrine no court, state or federal, can impose any different rate by way of damages or otherwise.  Id. at 577-80; see also Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953 (1986).  There is no federal cause of action for rate overcharges apart from the FERC remedies available under sections 205 and 206, but Section 317 of the Act provides categorically that federal district courts “shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of [the Act] or the rules, regulations and orders thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created [thereby].” 16 U.S.C. § 825p.

TALKING POINTS
FEDERAL INTERVENTION IN
CALIFORNIA-RELATED ENERGY LITIGATION

Message to the White House:
  .
 1. The power shortages and price volatility plaguing California (the world's 7th largest economy) cannot be confined to that state.  It is now and will continue to destabilize neighboring states, including earthquake injured Washington State.  This is because each is interdependent upon the same energy market, known as the Western Interconnection.  

 2. To prevent the crisis from spinning totally out of control when we enter the period of peak power consumption this summer, we must get those affected focused on coordinated, region-wide solutions ― a combination of price responsive reduced demand and more supply ― rather than recriminations over who and what caused the crisis.

RELATIONSHIP OF ENRON ENTITIES TO DEBTOR

  Pacific Gas & Electric Company (the “Debtor”) and Enron Corp., through numerous of its affiliates (collectively “Enron”),  have substantial business relationships that represent a significant portion of each company’s respective activities.  Enron transacts business with the Debtor through a multitude of direct and indirect contractual and tariff governed relationships.  Enron's claims against the Debtor in this bankruptcy proceeding are likely to be in excess of $570 million in the aggregate.  

  In addition to its interest in the bankruptcy case as a result of its significant claims, Enron would bring valuable energy industry expertise to the Creditors' Committee. In addition, based on virtually all analysis of the Debtor’s financial situation, any restructuring solution undoubtedly would involve putting in place long-term contracts for power and gas with suppliers.  Enron would anticipate playing a major role in that regard.

  Enron is the largest marketer of natural gas and power in the U.S. and one of the largest participants in the California energy market.  Enron's relationships with the Debtor include the sale of wholesale power (through Enron Power Marketing, Inc.) and natural gas (through Enron North America Corp.) and Enron Canada Corp.) to the Debtor;  EPMI’s sales in California’s daily and real time power market through the California Power Exchange (the “PX”) and the California Independent System Operator (the “ISO”); and the sale of power to the Debtor by a number of "qualifying facilities" owned and/or operated by Enron Wind Company.   An Enron owned regulated utility, Portland General Electric Company of Oregon, is the holder of significant pass through claims against the Debtor from the PX and ISO.  In addition, Enron's retail power affiliates have been, by far and away, the largest retail marketer of power in the Debtor's service area and in California as a whole. 

  The list ("Creditor List") of the Debtor's largest 20 creditors (which was prepared as of September 30, 2000, prior to the time that a significant portion of Enron's claims accrued) severely understates by hundreds of millions of dollars Enron's claims against the Debtor.  Those claims break down to the following approximate amounts:

Queries in G. C. Singh Writ Petition 



Is LNG the costliest fuel in the world today? Was it also so in 1993?
What is the background to the “cancellation” of the Enron project in Pakistan?
The figures mentioned in the Writ Petition must be checked.
What are the facts about the Teeside Project in the U.K.?
The calculations made in the Writ Petition should also be checked.
What are the facts about litigation in California against Enron?

GAS PROCESSING AGREEMENT CHRONOLOGY (“GPA”)


September 23, 1987: Effective date of GPA.  Enron Gas Processing (“EGP”) is the owner and operator of the hydrocarbon extraction plant at this time.

November 26, 1991: Enron Helium Company and Enron Equipment Company sell Bushton Gas Processing Plant to various Owner Participants through various Owner Trusts in a sale/leaseback agreement.  Trustees lease 100% of plant to EGP.  EGP continues to operate the plant.  This leasehold interest is the major asset that is eventually sold to KN.
  
October 21, 1995: EGP assigned the GPA to Enron Liquids Pipeline Operating Limited Partnership (“ELPOLP”).   EGP remains operator of the hydrocarbon extraction plant.

ELPOLP is composed of Enron Liquids Pipeline Company (“ELPC”) as general partner, and Enron Liquids Pipeline, L.P. (“ELP”), as limited partner.

[Draft 4/25/01]

Developments in the California Power Market

During 2000, prices for wholesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors, including higher natural gas prices and emission allowance costs, reduction in available hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, decreases in net electric imports, structural market flaws including over-reliance on the electric spot market, and limitations on supply as a result of maintenance and other outages.  California's regulatory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of California’s public utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E") and Southern California Edison Company ("SCE"),  to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power costs.  In early 2001, PG&E and SCE defaulted on payments owed for certain outstanding obligations, including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange (the "Power Exchange") and from the California Independent System Operator (the “Independent System Operator”).  In addition, PG&E and the Independent System Operator each have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. 

Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situation in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initiatives are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not possible to predict their outcome at this time.

Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utilities, the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator and various third parties.  As a result of these transactions, Enron is owed amounts by certain of these counterparties.  Enron has established credit reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition.

I notice that Chris Healy and his partner are going to argue the motion to 
stay. Are we ok with this? Also--could one of you call me after the conf. 
call and let me know if anything important is discussed.

Citrus Trading Corp. (“Citrus”) is in receipt of your letter dated June 26, 2000, claiming to give Duke Energy LNG Sales, Inc.’s (“Duke”) early termination notice of the Transaction Agreement.  Citrus rejects Dukes interpretation of Citrus’ position as a Triggering Event under the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated December 22, 1998, between Citrus and Duke.

Without waiving this position or any rights that Citrus has, Citrus agrees to participate in the price redetermination procedure contemplated by Article III, Sections 7 and 8 of the Transaction Agreement.  Because of the delay in Duke’s request for price redetermination, all of the deadlines  mandated by Section 8 have passed.  Citrus accepts Duke’s suggestion of working together to establish a schedule to carry out the price redetermination procedure, and I invite you to call me at your convenience to start the ball rolling.

Citrus’ agreement notwithstanding, Duke is well aware Article III Section 7 of the Amendment and Restatement of Gas Purchase Contract (the “Transaction Agreement”) specifically refers to the third “contract quarter” of the year 2000, not, as Duke appears to contend, the third quarter of that year.  As defined in the Transaction Agreement, a “Contract Year” as used in the Transaction Agreement means a period of twelve consecutive months beginning on the first Gas Day of September in each year.  The Transaction Agreement is clear that a request for redetermination must be made within 10 days of the start of the third contract quarter, which is March 1.  To the best of my knowledge Citrus has never led Duke to believe otherwise: if you disagree, please let me know the basis for that disagreement.

Neither party made a request for redetermination within the allotted time period.  Section 7 states that if no request is made, “the pricing and escalation provisions then in effect shall remain in effect for the remaining term of this Contract.”  Citrus reserves the right to assert its position to the appropriate tribunal.

Have a nice day.

BACKGROUND



The Canadian Competition Bureau has initiated an investigation of certain transactions involving Enron and Powerex during the period from June to October of 1999.
Apparently on referral from the Power Pool of Alberta, the Bureau is investigating whether Enron and Powerex colluded or engaged in “bid rigging” in certain power sales into the Alberta Power Pool.
The Bureau sent investigators to Enron’s Calgary office and Powerex’s office for several days at the end of May 2000.  Enron and Powerex did complete certain purchase and sale transactions during this period wherein Enron purchased power from Powerex and, on most occasions, was able to sell power into the Power Pool at a price higher than what it paid Powerex.  It appears that for 22 hours during this 5 month period Enron’s offers cleared the Power Pool’s merit order and were therefore accepted by the Pool.  It also appears that for 16 of those 22 hours, Enron’s offers established the market clearing price for the hour or some part of the hour.  
The Power Pool of Alberta has a price cap of CDN $1,000/MWh.  Enron’s market clearing sales ranged from less than CDN $100/MWh to as high as CDN $998/MWh.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of April ____, 2001 by and between Enron North America Corp. (“Enron”) and Duke Energy LNG Sales, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Duke LNG”).
WHEREAS, Enron and Duke LNG previously held certain confidential discussions respecting a possible transaction with Duke LNG and Sonatrach involving LNG purchases, transportation and terminalling, including the possible acquisition by Enron of the stock of Duke LNG;
WHEREAS, in connection with such discussions, Duke LNG may have provided to Enron certain information that is either confidential, proprietary or otherwise not generally available to the public; and
WHEREAS, Enron and Duke LNG now propose to enter into further confidential discussions of a possible transaction, which may include the acquisition by Enron or an affiliate thereof of the outstanding stock of Duke LNG (the “Potential Acquisition”) and, in connection therewith, are prepared to exchange certain information that is either confidential, proprietary or otherwise not generally available to the public for purposes of enabling the parties to evaluate their respective interest in a Potential Acquisition.
NOW THEREFORE, as a condition to exchanging such information, Enron and Duke LNG agree as follows:

Nondisclosure of Confidential Information.  The Confidential Information (as defined in Section 4) will be used solely for the purpose of discussions, negotiations and evaluation of the Potential Acquisition.  The Confidential Information will be kept confidential by the party receiving such information (the “Receiving Party”) and will not be disclosed to any other person; provided that (a) the Confidential Information may be disclosed to directors, officers, employees or representatives of the Receiving Party or any corporation or other entity that controls the Receiving Party (collectively, “Representatives”), but only if such Representatives need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose described above, and (b) any disclosure of the Confidential Information required by law may be made upon the conditions set forth in Section 3.  It is understood that (i) the Receiving Party shall inform any of its Representatives to whom Confidential Information is disclosed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the requirement that it not be used other than for the purpose described above, (ii) such Representatives shall be required to agree to and be bound by the terms of this Agreement as if a party hereto as a condition of receiving the Confidential Information, and (iii) the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.  The Receiving Party shall take reasonable steps to safeguard against unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information received from the party furnishing such information (the “Disclosing Party”).  
Disclosure of Confidential Information. Without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will not disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to any third party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Enron understands and agrees that, in order to facilitate a potential transaction, Duke LNG may disclose and explain to L’Enterprise Nationale Pour La Recherche, La Production, Le Transport, Le Transformation Et La Commercialisation Des Hydrocarbures (Sonatrach) (“Sonatrach”) or Sonatrading Amsterdam B.V. (“Sonatrading”) any proposal by Enron respecting a Potential Acquisition.  Accordingly, Enron will identify in writing any Confidential Information it discloses to Duke LNG that it does not wish Duke LNG to disclose to Sonatrach or Sonatrading.  Enron understands that Duke LNG may disclose to Sonatrach any of Enron’s Confidential Information that is not so identified.

MGAG/MGL ats Codelco: Case Summary
As requested by Paul Johnson as a matter of urgency earlier today, set out below is a preliminary note on the claim made by Codelco against Metallgesellschaft AG (“MGAG”), Metallgesellschaft Ltd (“MGL”) and Wolfgang Becker (formerly the MD of MG Commodity Corp (“MGCC”), a now defunct MGAG subsidiary) in the High Court in London.  This note assumes that the reader has no previous knowledge of the claim.

Codelco, which is the national copper producer in Chile, suffered huge losses as a result of the actions of the former head of its futures department, Juan Pablo Davila during the late eighties and early nineties.  While criminal investigations against Davila in Chile are on-going, Codelco has made civil claims arising out of those investigations against traders and brokers with whom Davila dealt, including the claim now made in the High Court proceedings against MGAG and MGL.
In those proceedings (no. CH2518 of 1996), Codelco claims that the defendants were party to a conspiracy to defraud and injure Codelco.  The conspiracy is said to have been orchestrated by Becker, who is alleged to have paid a bribe of US$1.5 million to Davila in return for Davila procuring Codelco to enter into futures and options transactions with MGAG and/or its subsidiaries, including MGL.  The allegation is that those transactions were either on unduly favourable terms and/or that the volume of that business increased as a result of the payment of the bribe.
The US$1.5 million was generated by Becker increasing the options premiums payable in respect of a min-max options contract entered into between MGCC and Codelco in late 1989, early 1990.  The claim is made against MGAG, rather than MGCC, because MGCC’s contracts with Codelco were entered into using MGAG letterhead (this was because MGCC, unlike MGAG and MGL, was unable to register as a broker with the Central Bank in Chile).  Becker was authorised to operate in this way pursuant to a power of attorney granted to him by MGAG and did so through MGAG’s agent in Chile, Vorwerk SA.
Following receipt of the US$1.5 million from Codelco, Becker caused it to be paid into a Cayman Island account details of which were given to him by Davila.  A paper trail, comprising three artificial futures transactions resulting in a net payment due to Codelco, was generated by Becker to justify the transfer.
Codelco claims that both the min-max contract and all subsequent futures transactions with MGAG were induced by the alleged bribe.  Those transactions span the period April 1989 to January 1994, when Davila was dismissed from Codelco.
MGL’s futures business transacted with Codelco during the same period is said to have been induced by the alleged bribe for two reasons.  First, Codelco claims that because MGL was MGAG’s subsidiary and had common directors and/or officers (ie, Dieter Worms), it can be inferred that MGL knew of the bribe and benefited from it.  Secondly, it is claimed that MGL knew of and benefited from the payment of the bribe because shortly after the min-max contract was entered into, MGL retained MGAG’s agent in Chile who had acted in connection with its entry into the min-max contract, namely, Vorwerk SA.  On the basis of the alleged joint agency of Vowerk SA, Codelco claims that Vorwerk SA’s knowledge of the bribe is to be imputed to MGL.
The defence case is that no bribe was paid and that the transfer payment was simply an accommodation made to Codelco, at its request, to transfer funds abroad on the understanding that they were required to purchase medical equipment for a military hospital in Chile.  The defendants claim that Davila requested Becker to make the transfer for that purpose; that the transfer was authorised and approved by the then President of Codelco, Patricio Contesse, in a meeting called by Vorwerk for that purpose; that after the min-max contract had been agreed, Davila requested the increase in the premiums to facilitate the payment; and that it was always understood that the Cayman Island account into which the US$1.5 million was transferred was a Codelco account (it only subsequently became apparent that it was Davila’s personal account).  In fact, US$500,000 of the transfer payment was used to purchase medical equipment for the Hospital Militar in Santiago costing US$1,060,000.  The balance of the purchase price, namely US$560,000, was paid by the Chilean Army.  We are currently investigating this matter in Chile.

California Electricity Investigations
Executive Summary
October 30, 2000

Overview As a result of the high electrical energy prices in California during the summer of 2000, Enron is aware of at least six separate investigations by governmental entities:  FERC, California PUC, United States General Accounting Office, California Controller, the California Legislature and California State Attorney General.  At least one PUC commissioner has stated publicly that it is the Commission’s goal to extract profits from market participants to pay for high energy prices.  On October 27th, PG&E filed an application to pass on $3.0 billion dollars in electrical costs to ratepayers. 
You have asked us to consider what legal theories these various investigators or others might use against Enron to establish civil or criminal liability.  Because we do not have a detailed understanding of all of the transactions that occurred during the summer of 2000, a large portion of our analysis is necessarily theoretical.  We do not attempt to speculate on specific Enron fact patterns here.  Instead, we provide here a broad brush overview focusing on the wholesale market and discuss particular theories in detail below.
Summary of Predominant Legal Theories Most of the legal theories we considered have a common theme – conduct in the market that is deemed to be deceptive,  fraudulent or have improperly influenced the price of electricity.   Assuming that there is no preemption by FERC (discussed below), then the most likely legal theories for most claimants will be (1) federal and state antitrust claims for either price fixing or collusive behavior with other market participants to affect price; and (2) California state unfair competition law, Business and Professions Code §17200.   If Enron is found to have engaged in deceptive or fraudulent practices, there is also the risk of other criminal legal theories such as wire fraud, RICO, fraud involving markets and fictitious commodity transactions.  In addition, depending upon the conduct, there may be the potential for criminal charges prosecuted against both individuals and the company.  
On the other hand, if the company has profited solely because of its skill, by accident or the result of a regulatory scheme created by others, it is unlikely that these legal theories will be successful ultimately.  Given the amount of money at stake (reported to be between 3 and 4 billion), we believe it is safe to assume that many potential claimants will believe it worthwhile to look long and hard  before reaching a conclusion as to where Enron’s conduct falls on the continuum.  
There is the possibility that some claimants and legal theories will be preempted because of FERC’s primary jurisdiction over the wholesale market.  For purposes of this analysis, we have assumed that if FERC’s jurisdiction preempts all other federal and state claims, then Enron is in somewhat uncharted waters.  Historically FERC has taken the view that it can not retroactively change rates it has approved.  If that view prevails, then it would seem unlikely that FERC would require some form of disgorgement of profits or payment of damages.
Potential Claimants Enron potentially could face claims from the federal government in the form of FERC or the Justice Department, state governments in the WSCC region, market participants as well as commercial and retail customers under  the above described federal and state regulatory, statutory and common law theories.

BACKGROUND



The Canadian Competition Bureau has initiated an investigation of certain transactions involving Enron and Powerex during the period from June to October of 1999.
Apparently on referral from the Alberta Power Pool, the Bureau is investigating whether Enron and Powerex colluded or engaged in “bid rigging” in certain power sales into the Alberta Power Pool.
The Bureau sent investigators to Enron and Powerex’s offices for several days at the end of May.  Enron and Powerex did complete certain purchase and sale transactions during this period wherein Enron purchased power from Powerex and, on most occasions, was able to sell power into the Alberta Pool at a price higher than what it paid Powerex.  For 22 hours during this period it appears that Enron’s sale established the market clearing price.
The Alberta Pool has a price cap of $1,000/MWh.  Enron’s market clearing sales ranged from less than $100/MWh to as high as $998.

Business Requirements Document – Voice Recording ECS



‘Record on demand’ is an option being considered by the Enron Traders. Vendors should provide details regarding their ability to do this, also specifying how they could provide compliance with State regulations requiring notification to both parties involved on a call that they are being recorded. (I know this isn not the case in Texas, but we need to cover all eventualities.)


Enron Traders require both Selective Recording and Archiving. Vendors should supply information regarding how they can provide a solution allowing different indviduals/groups to be recorded at specified times of day, and for different individuals/groups to have their recordings archived for variable time periods.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY/ATTORNEY AND ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Today Don Ray talked to Donnie Rhodes.  Donnie was aware the Beeson case had come down, and contends "I told them all along they should certify those excluded from Dow Waiver as the class"!  At any rate, Donnie said -- and as with all of Donnie's info, this must be taken with a grain of salt -- that Ronnie is no longer getting along with Joseph and King, and Ronnie is in charge of the case.  Donnie is still owed $80,000.  Nonetheless, if they asked, he would work for them on the case.  I suspect we will see him at the hearing working basically on a contingency, and with a whole new Dow Waiver theory of certification!

This is not a big deal.
No tariff was violated.
Cal PX has singled Enron out.
We settled to get the issue behind us.  The real issue concerns the need for further reform of the California power market.
This is not a big deal.

In the California market the power exchange (PX) runs a bid based market; it does not physically operate the system [analogy: it books reservations it does not take tickets, handle boarding or fly the plane].  The ISO manages actual physical power flows and maintains system reliability [analogy:  it is the air traffic controller].

Transmission congestion in California is a routine event. The market rules were set up anticipating congestion, congestion relief and counter-flows.

1. Enron fulfilled all of its obligations and played by the rules.  There was no threat to reliability.  There was no economic impact.  

2. The facts are on our side.  

On May 24, 1999, Enron offered a 2,900 MW power schedule thorough a 15 MW transmission line to the Cal PX for delivery on May 25, 1999.  The Cal PX accepted our offer for 2,900 MW in hours 8 – 22 and 2,381 MW in hour 7.  The Cal PX submitted the schedule to the California ISO.  The schedule created the potential for congestion.  Enron expected that other market participants would schedule power to eliminate the congestion.  They did not.  The California ISO implemented its congestion management process to handle the power flows. 

3. Enron did not violate any tariff or rule of either the Cal PX or the California ISO. 

The Cal PX submitted Enron’s schedule (acting as Enron’s Scheduling Coordinator) to the California ISO. The California ISO accepted Enron’s schedule.

This is not a big deal.
No tariff was violated.
Cal PX has singled Enron out.
We settled to get the issue behind us.  The real issue concerns the need for further reform of the California power market.
This is not a big deal.

Transmission congestion in California is a routine event. The market rules were set up anticipating congestion, congestion relief and counter-flows.

This is not a big deal.

In the California market the power exchange (PX) runs a bid based market; it does not physically operate the system [analogy: it books reservations it does not take tickets, handle boarding or fly the plane].  The ISO manages actual physical power flows and maintains system reliability [analogy:  it is the air traffic controller].

1. Enron fulfilled all of its obligations and played by the rules.  There was no threat to reliability.  There was no economic impact.  

2. The facts are on our side.  

On May 24, 1999, Enron offered a 2,900 MW power schedule thorough a 15 MW transmission line to the Cal PX for delivery on May 25, 1999.  The Cal PX accepted our offer for 2,900 MW in hours 8 – 22 and 2,381 MW in hour 7.  The Cal PX submitted the schedule to the California ISO.  The schedule created the potential for congestion.  Enron expected that other market participants would schedule power to eliminate the congestion.  They did not.  The California ISO implemented its congestion management process to handle the power flows. 

3. Enron did not violate any tariff or rule of either the Cal PX or the California ISO. 

The Cal PX submitted Enron’s schedule (acting as Enron’s Scheduling Coordinator) to the California ISO. The California ISO accepted Enron’s schedule.

EXPERIENCE

REPRESENTATIVE PROJECTS

On each of the projects described below and identified as KLTP projects the Deputy General Counsel  functions primarily as sole  in-house counsel with respect to the transactions.  The Deputy General Counsel works very independently and with minimal guidance and review.   Approval from General Counsel  is sought in specific instances with respect to policy matters and corporate governance issues.  Day to day work and decisions are handled at the Deputy General Counsel level.

 On each of the projects described below and identified as OPIC projects, I participated as the equivalent of a senior associate in most instances and a mid level associate in others.  The difference was in the level of review and participation by superiors.  The mid level work would have had as a participant a superior at many of the negotiations with borrowers.  However, the volume of work and the complexity of issues that I was responsible for resolving was consistent. 

Each of the projects described below required working in a team environment to resolve issues and problems.
