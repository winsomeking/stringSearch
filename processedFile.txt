by
the
ennui
of

away
from

eanwhile
ikolai
etrovitch
had
already
in
his
parents
lifetime
and
to
their
no
slight
chagrin
had
time
to
fall
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
his
landlord
a
petty
official
repolovensky
he
was
a
pretty
and
as
it
is
called
advanced
girl
she
used
to
read
the
serious
articles
in
the
cience
column
of
the
journals
e
married
her
directly
the
term
of
mourning
was
over
and
leaving
the
civil
service
in
which
his
father
had
by
favour
procured
him
a
post
was
perfectly
blissful
with
his
asha
first
in
a
country
villa
near
the
yesny
nstitute
afterwards
in
town
in
a
pretty
little
flat
with
a
clean
staircase
and
a
draughty
drawingroom
and
then
in
the
country
where
he
settled
finally
and
where
in
a
short
time
a
son
rkady
was
born
to
him
he
young
couple
lived
very
happily
and
peacefully
they
were
scarcely
ever
apart
they
read
together
sang
and
played
duets
together
on
the
piano
she
tended
her
flowers
and
looked
after
the
poultryyard
he
sometimes
went
hunting
and
busied
himself
with
the
estate
while
rkady
grew
and
grew
in
the
same
happy
and
peaceful
way
en
years
passed
like
a
dream
n
irsanovs
wife
died
e
almost
succumbed
to
this
blow
in
a
few
weeks
his
hair
was
grey
he
was
getting
ready
to
go
abroad
if
possible
to
distract
his
mind
but
then
came
the
year
e
returned
unwillingly
to
the
country
and
after
a
rather
prolonged
period
of
inactivity
began
to
take
an
interest
in
improvements
in
the
management
of
his
land
n
he
brought
his
son
to
the
university
he
spent
three
winters
with
him
in
etersburg
hardly
going
out
anywhere
and
trying
to
make
acquaintance
with
rkadys
young
companions
he
last
winter
he
had
not
been
able
to
go
and
here
we
have
him
in
the
ay
of
already
quite
grey
stoutish
and
rather
bent
waiting
for
his
son
who
had
just
taken
his
degree

had
taken
it
himselfhe

from
a
feeling
of
propriety
and
perhaps
too
not
anxious
to
remain
under
the
masters
eye
had
gone
to
the
gate
and
was
smoking
a
pipe
ikolai
etrovitch
bent
his
head
and
began
staring
at
the
crumbling
steps
a
big
mottled
fowl
walked
sedately
towards
him
treading
firmly
with
its
great
yellow
legs
a
muddy
cat
gave
him
an
unfriendly
look
twisting
herself
coyly
round
the
railing
he
sun
was
scorching
from
the
halfdark
passage
of
the
posting
station
came
an
odour
of
hot
ryebread
ikolai
etrovitch
fell
to
dreaming
y
son
a
graduate
rkasha
were
the
ideas
that
continually
came
round
again
and
again
in
his
head
he
tried
to
think
of
something
else
and
again
the
same
thoughts
returned
e
remembered
his
dead
wife
he
did
not
live
to
see
it
he
murmured
sadly

into

and
hurriedly
went
to
drink
in
a

looking
at
it
but
his
ear
had
already
caught

of

rkady
in
a

tired
from

boyish
and
clear
as

gaily
responded
to
his
fathers
caresses

in

smiled
affectionately
hat
a
thing
to
apologise
for
he
thought
to
himself
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
a
feeling
of
condescending
tenderness
for
his
kind
softhearted
father
mixed
with
a
sense
of
secret
superiority
lease
stop
he
repeated
once
more
instinctively
revelling
in
a
consciousness
of
his
own
advanced
and
emancipated
conditionikolai
etrovitch
glanced
at
him
from
under
the
fingers
of
the
hand
with
which
he
was
still
rubbing
his
forehead
and
there
was
a
pang
in
his
heart
ut
at
once
he
blamed
himself
for
itere
are
our
meadows
at
last
he
said
after
a
long
silencend
that
in
front
is
our
forest

renthats
their
affair
besides
they
will
pay
it
some
day
am
sorry
about
the
forest
observed
rkady
and
he
began
to
look
about
himhe
country
through
which
they
were
driving
could
not
be
called
picturesque
ields
upon
fields
stretched
all
along
to
the
very
horizon
now
sloping
gently
upwards
then
dropping
down
again
in
some
places
woods
were
to
be
seen
and
winding
ravines
planted
with
low
scanty
bushes
recalling
vividly
the
representation
of
them
on
the
oldfashioned
maps
of
the
times
of
atherine
hey
came
upon
little
streams
too
with
hollow
banks
and
tiny
lakes
with
narrow
dykes
and
little
villages
with
low
hovels
under
dark
and
often
tumbledown
roofs
and
slanting
barns
with
walls
woven
of
brushwood
and
gaping
doorways
beside
neglected
threshingfloors
and
churches
some
brickbuilt
with
stucco
peeling
off
in
patches
others
wooden
with
crosses
fallen
askew
and
overgrown
graveyards
lowly
rkadys
heart
sunk
o
complete
the
picture
the
peasants
they
met
were
all
in
tatters
and
on
the
sorriest
little
nags
the
willows
with
their
trunks
stripped
of
bark
and
broken
branches
stood
like
ragged
beggars
along
the
roadside
cows
lean
and
shaggy
and
looking
pinched
up
by
hunger
were
greedily
tearing
at
the
grass
along
the
ditches
hey
looked
as
though
they
had
just
been
snatched
out
of
the
murderous
clutches
of
some
threatening
monster
and
the
piteous
state
of
the
weak
starved
beasts
in
the
midst
of
the
lovely
spring
day
called
up
like
a
white
phantom
the
endless
comfortless
winter
with
its
storms
and
frosts
and
snows
o
thought
rkady
this
is
not
a
rich
country
it
does
not
impress
one
by
plenty
or
industry
it
cant
it
cant
go
on
like
this
reforms
are
absolutely
necessary
but
how
is
one
to
carry
them
out
how
is
one
to
beginuch
were
rkadys
reflections
but
even
as
he
reflected
the
spring
regained
its
sway
ll
around
was
golden
green
alltrees
bushes
grassshone
and
stirred
gently
in
wide
waves
under
the
soft
breath
of
the
warm
wind
from
all
sides
flooded
the
endless
trilling
music
of
the
larks
the
peewits
were
calling
as
they
hovered
over
the
lowlying
meadows
or
noiselessly
ran
over
the
tussocks
of
grass
the
rooks
strutted
among
the
halfgrown
short
springcorn
standing
out
black
against
its
tender
green
they
disappeared
in
the
already
whitening
rye
only
from
time
to
time
their
heads
peeped
out
amid
its
grey
waves
rkady
gazed
and
gazed
and
his
reflections
grew
slowly
fainter
and
passed
away
e
flung
off
his
cloak
and
turned
to
his
father
with
a
face
so
bright
and
boyish
that
the
latter
gave
him
another
hugere
not
far
off
now
remarked
ikolai

etrovitch
stopped
while
rkady
who
had
begun
listening
to
him
with
some
surprise
though
with
sympathy
too
made
haste
to
pull
a
silver
matchbox
out
of

rkadyiotr
returned
to
the
carriage
and
handed
him
with
the
matchbox
a
thick
black
cigar
which
rkady
began
to
smoke
promptly
diffusing
about
him
such
a
strong
and
pungent
odour
of
cheap
tobacco
that
ikolai
etrovitch
who
had
never
been
a
smoker
from
his
youth
up
was
forced
to
turn
away
his
head
as
imperceptibly
as
he
could
for
fear
of
wounding
his
son
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
two
carriages
drew
up
before
the
steps
of
a
new
wooden

etrovitch
with
his
son
and
azarov
walked
through
a
dark
and
almost
empty
hall
from
behind
the
door
of
which
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
young
womans
face
into
a
drawingroom
furnished
in
the
most
modern
styleere

with
an
air
of
perplexity
picked
up
azarovs
garment
in
both
hands
and
holding
it
high
above
his
head
retreated
on
tiptoe
nd
you
rkady
are

to
your
room
for
a
minutees

wash
answered
rkady
and
was
just
moving
towards
the
door
but
at
that
instant
there
came
into
the
drawingroom
a
man
of
medium
height
dressed
in
a
dark
nglish
suit
a
fashionable
low
cravat
and
kid
shoes
avel
etrovitch
irsanov
e
looked
about
fortyfive
his
closecropped
grey
hair
shone
with
a
dark
lustre
like
new
silver
his
face
yellow
but
free
from
wrinkles
was
exceptionally
regular
and
pure
in
line
as
though
carved
by
a
light
and
delicate
chisel
and
showed
traces
of
remarkable
beauty
specially
fine
were
his
clear
black
almondshaped
eyes
he
whole
person
of
rkadys
uncle
with
its
aristocratic
elegance
had
preserved
the
gracefulness
of
youth
and
that
air
of
striving
upwards
away
from
earth
which
for
the
most
part
is
lost
after
the
twenties
are
pastavel
etrovitch
took
out
of
his
trouser
pocket
his
exquisite
hand
with
its
long
tapering
pink
nails
a
hand
which
seemed
still
more
exquisite
from
the
snowy
whiteness
of
the
cuff
buttoned
with
a
single
big
opal
and
gave
it
to
his
nephew
fter
a
preliminary
handshake
in
the
uropean
style
he
kissed
him
thrice
after
the
ussian
fashion
that
is
to
say
he
touched
his
cheek
three
times
with
his
perfumed
moustaches
and
said
elcomeikolai
etrovitch
presented
him
to
azarov
avel
etrovitch
greeted
him
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
supple
figure
and
a
slight
smile
but
he
did
not
give
him
his
hand
and
even
put
it
back
into
his
pocket
had
begun
to
think
you
were
not
coming
today
he
began
in
a
musical
voice
with
a
genial
swing
and
shrug
of
the
shoulders
as
he
showed
his
splendid
white
teeth

rkady

azarov
pulling
himself
up
suddenly
from
the
sofa
oth
the
young
men
went
outho

asked

he
remarked
m
glad
he
has
come
backt
supper
there
was
little
conversation
azarov
especially
said
nothing
but
he
ate
a
great
deal
ikolai
etrovitch
related
various
incidents
in
what
he
called
his
career
as
a
farmer
talked
about
the
impending
government
measures
about
committees
deputations
the
necessity
of
introducing
machinery
etc
avel
etrovitch
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
diningroom
he
never
ate
supper
sometimes
sipping
at
a
wineglass
of
red
wine
and
less
often
uttering
some
remark
or
rather
exclamation
of
the
nature
of
h
aha
hm
rkady
told
some
news
from
etersburg
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
little
awkwardness
that
awkwardness
which
usually
overtakes
a
youth
when
he
has
just
ceased
to
be
a
child
and
has
come
back
to
a
place
where
they
are
accustomed
to
regard
him
and
treat
him
as
a
child
e
made
his
sentences
quite
unnecessarily
long
avoided
the
word
daddy
and
even
sometimes
replaced
it
by
the
word
father
mumbled
it
is
true
between
his
teeth
with
an
exaggerated
carelessness
he
poured
into
his
glass
far
more
wine
than
he
really
wanted
and
drank
it
all
off
rokofitch
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
and
kept
chewing
his
lips
fter
supper
they
all
separated

onceour

queer

azarov
said
to
rkady
as
he
sat
in
his
dressinggown
by
his
bedside
smoking
a
short
pipe

it
up
in

of
the
past
ts
a
pity
theres
no
one
for
him
to
fascinate
here
though
kept
staring
at
his
exquisite
collars
heyre
like

his

shook
his
head
as
though
he
himself
were
not
shy
and
nervousts
something
astonishing
pursued
azarov
these
old
idealists
they
develop
their
nervous
systems
till
they
break
down
so
balance
is
lost
ut

went
away
and
a
sense
of
great
happiness
came
over
rkady
weet
it
is
to
fall
asleep
in
ones
own
home
in
the
familiar
bed
under
the
quilt
worked
by
loving
hands
perhaps
a
dear
nurses
hands
those
kind
tender
untiring
hands
rkady
remembered
egorovna
and
sighed
and
wished
her
peace
in
heaven
or
himself
he
made
no
prayeroth
he
and
azarov
were
soon
asleep
but
others
in
the
house
were
awake
long
after
is
sons
return
had
agitated
ikolai
etrovitch
e
lay
down
in
bed
but
did
not
put
out
the
candles
and
his
head
propped
on
his
hand
he
fell
into
long
reveries
is
brother
was
sitting
long
after
midnight
in
his
study
in
a
wide
armchair
before
the
fireplace
on
which
there
smouldered
some
faintly
glowing
embers
avel
etrovitch
was
not
undressed
only
some
red
hinese
slippers
had
replaced
the
kid
shoes
on
his
feet
e
held
in
his
hand
the
last
number
of
alignani
but
he
was
not
reading
he
gazed
fixedly
into
the
grate
where
a
bluish
flame
flickered
dying
down
then
flaring
up
again
od
knows
where
his
thoughts
were
rambling
but
they
were
not
rambling
in
the
past
only
the
expression
of
his
face
was
concentrated
and
surly
which
is
not
the
way
when
a
man
is
absorbed
solely
in
recollections
n
a
small
back
room
there
sat
on
a
large
chest
a
young
woman
in
a
blue
dressing
jacket
with
a
white
kerchief
thrown
over
her
dark
hair
enitchka
he
was
half
listening
half
dozing
and
often
looked
across
towards
the
open
door
through
which
a
childs
cradle
was
visible
and
the
regular
breathing
of
a
sleeping
baby
could
be
heard
he
next
morning
azarov
woke
up
earlier
than
any
one
and
went
out
of
the
house
h
my
he
thought
looking
about
him
the
little
place
isnt
much
to
boast
of
hen
ikolai
etrovitch
had
divided
the
land
with
his
peasants
he
had
had
to
build
his
new
manorhouse
on
four
acres
of
perfectly
flat
and
barren
land
e
had
built
a
house
offices
and
farm
buildings
laid
out
a
garden
dug
a
pond
and
sunk
two
wells
but
the
young
trees
had
not
done
well
very
little
water
had
collected
in
the
pond
and
that
in
the
wells
tasted
brackish
nly
one
arbour
of
lilac
and
acacia
had
grown
fairly
well
they
sometimes
had
tea
and
dinner
in
it
n
a
few
minutes
azarov
had
traversed
all
the
little
paths
of
the
garden
he
went
into
the
cattleyard
and
the
stable
routed
out
two
farmboys
with
whom
he
made
friends
at
once
and
set
off
with
them
to
a
small
swamp
about
a
mile
from
the
house
to
look
for
frogshat
do
you
want

went
out
on
to

among

bunches
of

up
the

who
had
been

to

gave

ikolai

hurriedly
rkady
how
do
you

answered
rkady
and
after
a
brief
silence
he
uttered
interrogatively

me

if
my

unsuitable
to

he
began
but
you

by
your
openness

to
be
open
you
will
not
be

give

hereikolai
etrovitch
turned
slightly
awayerhaps
he
said
at
last
she
supposes
she
is
ashamedrkady
turned
a
rapid
glance
on
his
fatherhe
has
no
need
to
be
ashamed
n
the
first
place
you
are
aware
of
my
views
it
was
very
sweet
to
rkady
to
utter
that
word
and
secondly
could
be
willing
to
hamper
your
life
your
habits
in
the
least
thing
esides
am
sure
you
could
not
make
a
bad
choice
if
you
have
allowed
her
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
you
she
must
be
worthy
of
it
in
any
case
a
son
can
not
judge
his
fatherleast
of
all
and
least
of
all
such
a
father
who
like
you
has
never
hampered
my
liberty
in
anythingrkadys
voice
had
been
shaky
at
the
beginning
he
felt
himself
magnanimous
though
at
the
same
time
he
realised
he
was
delivering
something
of
the
nature
of
a
lecture
to
his
father
but
the
sound
of
ones
own
voice
has
a
powerful
effect
on
any
man
and
rkady
brought
out
his
last
words
resolutely
even
with
emphasishanks
rkasha
said
ikolai
etrovitch
thickly
and
his
fingers
again
strayed
over
his
eyebrows
and
forehead
our
suppositions
are
just
in
fact
f
course
if
this
girl
had
not
deserved
t
is
not
a
frivolous
caprice
ts
not
easy
for
me
to
talk
to
you
about
this
but
you
will
understand
that
it
is
difficult
for
her
to
come
here
in
your
presence
especially
the
first
day
of
your
returnn
that
case
will
go
to
her
cried
rkady
with
a
fresh
rush
of
magnanimous
feeling
and
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
will
explain
to
her
that
she
has
no
need
to
be
ashamed
before
meikolai
etrovitch
too
got
uprkady
he
began
be
so
good
how
can
there
have
not
told
you
yet
ut
rkady
did
not
listen
to
him
and
ran
off
the
terrace
ikolai
etrovitch
looked
after
him
and
sank
into
his
chair
overcome
by
confusion
is
heart
began
to
throb
id
he
at
that
moment
realise
the
inevitable
strangeness
of
the
future
relations
between
him
and
his
son
as
he
conscious
that
rkady
would
perhaps
have
shown
him
more
respect
if
he
had
never
touched
on
this
subject
at
all
id
he
reproach
himself
for
weaknessit
is
hard
to
say
all
these
feelings
were
within
him
but
in
the
state
of
sensationsand
vague
sensationswhile
the
flush
did
not
leave
his
face
and
his
heart
throbbedhere
was
the
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
and
rkady
came
on
to
the
terrace
e
have
made
friends

he
cried
with
an
expression
of
a
kind
of
affectionate
and
goodnatured
triumph
on
his
face
edosya

later

just
nowikolai
etrovitch
tried
to
articulate
something
tried
to
get
up
and
open
his
arms
rkady
flung
himself
on
his
neckhats
this
embracing
again
sounded
the
voice
of
avel
etrovitch
behind
themather
and
son
were
equally
rejoiced
at
his
appearance
at
that
instant
there
are
positions
genuinely
affecting
from
which
one
longs
to
escape
as
soon
as
possiblehy
should
you

down

a

on

and
the
carelessly

was
overwhelmed

rushed
in
a
wave
of
crimson
over
the
delicate
skin
of
her
pretty
face
he
dropped
her

and
stood
at
the
table
leaning
a
little
on
the
very
tips
of
her
fingers
t
seemed
as
though
she
were
ashamed
of
having
come
in

at
the

felt
that
she
had

to

resonant

with
a
sidelong
glance
at
rkady
who
gave
her
a
friendly
smile
she
went
gently
away

at

etrovitch
shrugged
his

stealthily
avel
etrovitch
himself
felt
that
his
epigram
was
unsuccessful
and
began
to
talk
about
husbandry
and
the
new
bailiff
who
had
come
to
him
the
evening
before
to
complain
that
a
labourer
oma
was
deboshed

quite
unmanageable

such
an

down

hastily
drinking

looked
at

in
silence
while
rkady
stealthily
watched
first
his

and
then
his
uncleid
you

ikolai
etrovitch

azarov
answered

etrovitch
had
used
with
ironical
intention
none
noticed

such
a
high
opinion
of

said
avel
etrovitch
with
exaggerated
courtesy
e
was
beginning
to
feel
a
secret
irritation

aristocratic

was
revolted
by
azarovs
absolute
nonchalance
his
surgeons
son
was
not
only
not
overawed
he
even
gave
abrupt
and
indifferent
answers
and
in
the
tone
of

churlish
almost
insolenthe

declared
drawing

up
and
throwing

said
avel

assumed

unsympathetic
as
remote
as

cloudy
heightot

azarov
with
a
short
yawn
e
obviously
did
not

etrovitch
glanced
at

as
though
he
would
say

nd
rkady
told
him
his
uncles
story
he
reader
will
find
it
in
the
following
chapter
avel
etrovitch
irsanov
was
educated
first
at
home
like
his
younger
brother
and
afterwards
in
the
orps
of
ages
rom
childhood
he
was
distinguished
by
remarkable
beauty
moreover
he
was
selfconfident
somewhat
ironical
and
had
a
rather
biting
humour
he
could
not
fail
to
please
e
began
to
be
seen
everywhere
directly
he
had
received
his
commission
as
an
officer
e
was
much
admired
in
society
and
he
indulged
every
whim
even
every
caprice
and
every
folly
and
gave
himself
airs
but
that
too
was
attractive
in
him
omen
went
out
of
their
senses
over
him
men
called
him
a
coxcomb
and
were
secretly
jealous
of
him
e
lived
as
has
been
related
already
in
the
same
apartments
as
his
brother
whom
he
loved
sincerely
though
he
was
not
at
all
like
him
ikolai
etrovitch
was
a
little
lame
he
had
small
pleasing
features
of
a
rather
melancholy
cast
small
black
eyes
and
thin
soft
hair
he
liked
being
lazy
but
he
also
liked
reading
and
was
timid
in
societyavel
etrovitch
did
not
spend
a
single
evening
at
home
prided
himself
on
his
ease
and
audacity
he
was
just
bringing
gymnastics
into
fashion
among
young
men
in
society
and
had
read
in
all
some
five
or
six
rench
books
t
twentyeight
he
was
already
a
captain
a
brilliant
career
awaited
him
uddenly
everything
was
changedt
that
time
there
was
sometimes
seen
in
etersburg
society
a
woman
who
has
even
yet
not
been
forgotten
rincess
he
had
a
welleducated
wellbred
but
rather
stupid
husband
and
no
children
he
used
suddenly
to
go
abroad
and
suddenly
return
to
ussia
and
led
an
eccentric
life
in
general
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
frivolous
coquette
abandoned
herself
eagerly
to
every
sort
of
pleasure
danced
to
exhaustion
laughed
and
jested
with
young
men
whom
she
received
in
the
dim
light
of
her
drawingroom
before
dinner
while
at
night
she
wept
and
prayed
found
no
peace
in
anything
and
often
paced
her
room
till
morning
wringing
her
hands
in
anguish
or
sat
pale
and
chill
over
a
psalter
ay
came
and
she
was
transformed
again
into
a
grand
lady
again
she
went
out
laughed
chattered
and
simply
flung
herself
headlong
into
anything
which
could
afford
her
the
slightest
distraction
he
was
marvellously
wellproportioned
her
hair
coloured
like
gold
and
heavy
as
gold
hung
below
her
knees
but
no
one
would
have
called
her
a
beauty
in
her
whole
face
the
only
good
point
was
her
eyes
and
even
her
eyes
were
not
goodthey
were
grey
and
not
largebut
their
glance
was
swift
and
deep
unconcerned
to
the
point
of
audacity
and
thoughtful
to
the
point
of
melancholyan
enigmatic
glance
here
was
a
light
of
something
extraordinary
in
them
even
while
her
tongue
was
lisping
the
emptiest
of
inanities
he
dressed
with
elaborate
care
avel
etrovitch
met
her
at
a
ball
danced
a
mazurka
with
her
in
the
course
of
which
she
did
not
utter
a
single
rational
word
and
fell
passionately
in
love
with
her
eing
accustomed
to
make
conquests
in
this
instance
too
he
soon
attained
his
object
but
his
easy
success
did
not
damp
his
ardour
n
the
contrary
he
was
in
still
more
torturing
still
closer
bondage
to
this
woman
in
whom
even
at
the
very
moment
when
she
surrendered
herself
utterly
there
seemed
always
something
still
mysterious
and
unattainable
to
which
none
could
penetrate
hat
was
hidden
in
that
soulod
knows
t
seemed
as
though
she
were
in
the
power
of
mysterious
forces
incomprehensible
even
to
herself
they
seemed
to
play
on
her
at
will
her
intellect
was
not
powerful
enough
to
master
their
caprices
er
whole
behaviour
presented
a
series
of
inconsistencies
the
only
letters
which
could
have
awakened
her
husbands
just
suspicions
she
wrote
to
a
man
who
was
almost
a
stranger
to
her
whilst
her
love
had
always
an
element
of
melancholy
with
a
man
she
had
chosen
as
a
lover
she
ceased
to
laugh
and
to
jest
she
listened
to
him
and
gazed
at
him
with
a
look
of
bewilderment
ometimes
for
the
most
part
suddenly
this
bewilderment
passed
into
chill
horror
her
face
took
a
wild
deathlike
expression
she
locked
herself
up
in
her
bedroom
and
her
maid
putting
her
ear
to
the
keyhole
could
hear
her
smothered
sobs
ore
than
once
as
he
went
home
after
a
tender
interview
irsanov
felt
within
him
that
heartrending
bitter
vexation
which
follows
on
a
total
failurehat
more
do
want
he
asked
himself
while
his
heart
was
heavy
e
once
gave
her
a
ring
with
a
sphinx
engraved
on
the
stonehats
that
she
asked
a
sphinxes
he
answered
and
that
sphinx
is
you
she
queried
and
slowly
raising
her
enigmatical
glance
upon
him
o
you
know
thats
awfully
flattering
she
added
with
a
meaningless
smile
while
her
eyes
still
kept
the
same
strange
lookavel
etrovitch
suffered
even
while
rincess
loved
him
but
when
she
grew
cold
to
him
and
that
happened
rather
quickly
he
almost
went
out
of
his
mind
e
was
on
the
rack
and
he
was
jealous
he
gave
her
no
peace
followed
her
about
everywhere
she
grew
sick
of
his
pursuit
of
her
and
she
went
abroad
e
resigned
his
commission
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
and
the
exhortations
of
his
superiors
and
followed
the
princess
four
years
he
spent
in
foreign
countries
at
one
time
pursuing
her
at
another
time
intentionally
losing
sight
of
her
e
was
ashamed
of
himself
he
was
disgusted
with
his
own
lack
of
spirit
but
nothing
availed
er
image
that
incomprehensible
almost
meaningless
but
bewitching
image
was
deeply
rooted
in
his
heart
t
aden
he
once
more
regained
his
old
footing
with
her
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
never
loved
him
so
passionately
but
in
a
month
it
was
all
at
an
end
the
flame
flickered
up
for
the
last
time
and
went
out
for
ever
oreseeing
inevitable
separation
he
wanted
at
least
to
remain
her
friend
as
though
friendship
with
such
a
woman
was
possible
he
secretly
left
aden
and
from
that
time
steadily
avoided
irsanov
e
returned
to
ussia
and
tried
to
live
his
former
life
again
but
he
could
not
get
back
into
the
old
groove
e
wandered
from
place
to
place
like
a
man
possessed
he
still
went
into
society
he
still
retained
the
habits
of
a
man
of
the
world
he
could
boast
of
two
or
three
fresh
conquests
but
he
no
longer
expected
anything
much
of
himself
or
of
others
and
he
undertook
nothing
e
grew
old
and
grey
spending
all
his
evenings
at
the
club
jaundiced
and
bored
and
arguing
in
bachelor
society
became
a
necessity
for
hima
bad
sign
as
we
all
know
arriage
of
course
he
did
not
even
think
of
en
years
passed
in
this
way
they
passed
by
colourless
and
fruitlessand
quickly
fearfully
quickly
owhere
does
time
fly
past
as
in
ussia
in
prison
they
say
it
flies
even
faster
ne
day
at
dinner
at
the
club
avel
etrovitch
heard
of
the
death
of
the
rincess
he
had
died
at
aris
in
a
state
bordering
on
insanitye
got
up
from
the
table
and
a
long
time
he
paced
about
the
rooms
of
the
club
or
stood
stockstill
near
the
cardplayers
but
he
did
not
go
home
earlier
than
usual
ome
time
later
he
received
a
packet
addressed
to
him
in
it
was
the
ring
he
had
given
the
princess
he
had
drawn
lines
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
over
the
sphinx
and
sent
him
word
that
the
solution
of
the
enigmawas
the
crosshis
happened
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
at
the
very
time
when
ikolai
etrovitch
came
to
etersburg
after
the
loss
of
his
wife
avel
etrovitch
had
scarcely
seen
his
brother
since
the
latter
had
settled
in
the
country
the
marriage
of
ikolai
etrovitch
had
coincided
with
the
very
first
days
of
avel
etrovitchs
acquaintance
with
the
princess
hen
he
came
back
from
abroad
he
had
gone
to
him
with
the
intention
of
staying
a
couple
of
months
with
him
in
sympathetic
enjoyment
of
his
happiness
but
he
had
only
succeeded
in
standing
a
week
of
it
he
difference
in
the
positions
of
the
two
brothers
was
too
great
n
this
difference
had
grown
less
ikolai
etrovitch
had
lost
his
wife
avel
etrovitch
had
lost
his
memories
after
the
death
of
the
princess
he
tried
not
to
think
of
her
ut
to
ikolai
there
remained
the
sense
of
a
wellspent
life
his
son
was
growing
up
under
his
eyes
avel
on
the
contrary
a
solitary
bachelor
was
entering
upon
that
indefinite
twilight
period
of
regrets
that
are
akin
to
hopes
and
hopes
that
are
akin
to
regrets
when
youth
is
over
while
old
age
has
not
yet
comehis
time
was
harder
for
avel
etrovitch
than
for
another
man
in
losing
his
past
he
lost
everything
will
not
invite
you
to
aryino
now
ikolai
etrovitch
said
to
him
one
day
he
had
called
his
property
by
that
name
in
honour
of
his
wife
you
were
dull
there
in
my
dear
wifes
time
and
now
think
you
would
be
bored
to
death
was
stupid
and
fidgety
then
answered
avel
etrovitch
since
then
have
grown
quieter
if
not
wiser
n
the
contrary
now
if
you
will
let
me
am
ready
to
settle
with
you
for
goodor
all
answer
ikolai
etrovitch
embraced
him
but
a
year
and
a
half
passed
after
this
conversation
before
avel
etrovitch
made
up
his
mind
to
carry
out
his
intention
hen
he
was
once
settled
in
the
country
however
he
did
not
leave
it
even
during
the
three
winters
which
ikolai
etrovitch
spent
in
etersburg
with
his
son
e
began
to
read
chiefly
nglish
he
arranged
his
whole
life
roughly
speaking
in
the
nglish
style
rarely
saw
the
neighbours
and
only
went
out
to
the
election
of
marshals
where
he
was
generally
silent
only
occasionally
annoying
and
alarming
landowners
of
the
old
school
by
his
liberal
sallies
and
not
associating
with
the
representatives
of
the
younger
generation
oth
the
latter
and
the
former
considered
him
stuck
up
and
both
parties
respected
him
for
his
fine
aristocratic
manners
for
his
reputation
for
successes
in
love
for
the
fact
that
he
was
very
well
dressed
and
always
stayed
in
the
best
room
in
the
best
hotel
for
the
fact
that
he
generally
dined
well
and
had
once
even
dined
with
ellington
at
ouis
hilippes
table
for
the
fact
that
he
always
took
everywhere
with
him
a
real
silver
dressingcase
and
a
portable
bath
for
the
fact
that
he
always
smelt
of
some
exceptionally
good
form
scent
for
the
fact
that
he
played
whist
in
masterly
fashion
and
always
lost
and
lastly
they
respected
him
also
for
his
incorruptible
honesty
adies
considered
him
enchantingly
romantic
but
he
did
not
cultivate
ladies
acquaintanceo
you
see
evgeny
observed
rkady
as
he
finished
his
story
how
unjustly
you
judge
of
my
uncle
o
say
nothing
of
his
having
more
than
once
helped
my
father
out
of
difficulties
given
him
all
his
moneythe
property
perhaps
you
dont
know
wasnt
dividedhes
glad
to
help
any
one
among
other
things
he
always
sticks
up
for
the
peasants
its
true
when
he
talks
to
them
he
frowns
and
sniffs

continued
rkady

me
its
a
sin
to

azarov

that

stakes
his
whole
life
on
one
carda

when
that

you
ought
to

to
be

hes
not
got
rid
of
all
his

that

off
to
azarovs
room
which
was
already
pervaded
by
a
sort
of
medicosurgical
odour
mingled
with
the
smell
of
cheap
tobacco
avel
etrovitch
did
not
long
remain
present
at
his
brothers
interview
with
his
bailiff
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
sweet
consumptive
voice
and
knavish
eyes
who
to
all
ikolai
etrovitchs
remarks
answered
ertainly
sir
and
tried
to
make
the
peasants
out
to
be
thieves
and
drunkards
he
estate
had
only
recently
been
put
on
to
the
new
reformed
system
and
the
new
mechanism
worked
creaking
like
an
ungreased
wheel
warping
and
cracking
like
homemade
furniture
of
unseasoned
wood
ikolai
etrovitch
did
not
lose
heart
but
often
he
sighed
and
was
gloomy
he
felt
that
the
thing
could
not
go
on
without
money
and
his
money
was
almost
all
spent
rkady
had
spoken
the
truth
avel
etrovitch
had
more
than
once
helped
his
brother
more
than
once
seeing
him
struggling
and
cudgelling
his
brains
at
a
loss
which
way
to
turn
avel
etrovitch
moved
deliberately
to
the
window
and
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
muttered
between
his
teeth
mais
je
puis
vous
de
largent
and
gave
him
money
but
today
he
had
none
himself
and
he
preferred
to
go
away
he
petty
details
of
agricultural
management
worried
him
besides
it
constantly
struck
him
that
ikolai
etrovitch
for
all
his
zeal
and
industry
did
not
set
about
things
in
the
right
way
though
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
point
out
precisely
where
ikolai
etrovitchs
mistake
lay
y
brothers
not
practical
enough
he
reasoned
to
himself
they
impose
upon
him
ikolai
etrovitch
on
the
other
hand
had
the
highest
opinion
of
avel
etrovitchs
practical
ability
and
always
asked
his
advice
m
a
soft

answered
enitchka
and
she
went
out
quicklyavel
etrovitch
was
left
alone
and
he
looked
round

with
special
attention
he
small
lowpitched
room
in
which
he
found
himself
was
very
clean
and
snug

of

under

muslin
canopy
beside
an
ironclamped
chest
with
a

n
the

a

was
burning

was
particularly
fond
of
that

a
long
cord
from
the

a
cage
hung
with
a
shorttailed
siskin
in
it
he
was
constantly
chirping
and
hopping
about
the
cage

constantly
shaking
and
swinging
while

fell
with
a
light
tap
on
to
the
floor
n
the
wall
just
above
a
small
chest
of
drawers
hung
some
rather
bad
photographs
of
ikolai
etrovitch
in
various
attitudes
taken
by
an
itinerant
photographer
there
too
hung
a
photograph
of
enitchka
herself
which
was
an
absolute
failure
it
was
an
eyeless
face
wearing
a
forced
smile
in
a
dingy
frame
nothing
more
could
be
made
out
while
above
enitchka
eneral
ermolov
in
a
ircassian
cloak
scowled
menacingly
upon

aucasian
mountains
in
the
distance
from
beneath
a
little
silk
shoe
for
pins
which
fell
right
on
to
his
browsive
minutes
passed
bustling
and
whispering
could
be
heard
in
the
next
room
avel
etrovitch
took
up
from
the
chest
of
drawers
a
greasy
book
an
odd
volume
of
asalskys
usketeer
and
turned
over
a
few
pages
he
door
opened
and
enitchka
came
in
with
itya
in
her
arms
he
had
put
on
him
a
little
red
smock
with
embroidery
on
the
collar
had
combed
his
hair
and
washed
his
face
he
was
breathing
heavily
his
whole
body
working
and
his
little
hands
waving
in
the
air
as
is
the
way
with
all
healthy
babies
but
his
smart
smock
obviously
impressed
him
an
expression
of
delight
was
reflected
in
every
part
of
his
little
fat
person
enitchka
had
put
her
own
hair
too
in
order
and
had
arranged
her
kerchief
but
she
might
well
have
remained
as
she
was
nd
really
is
there
anything
in
the
world
more
captivating
than
a
beautiful
young
mother
with
a
healthy
baby

armshat

said
avel
etrovitch
graciously
and
he
tickled

mournfully
at

repeated
in
a
whisper

so

was
heard
suddenly
the
voice
of
ikolai

etrovitch
turned
hurriedly
round
frowning
but
his
brother
looked
at
him
with
such
delight
such
gratitude
that
he
could
not
help
responding
to
his
smileouve
a
splendid
little
cherub
he
said
and
looking
at
his
watch
came
in
here
to
speak
about
some
teand
assuming
an
expression
of
indifference
avel
etrovitch
at
once
went
out
of
the
roomid

come

he
said
suddenly
brightening
and
going
up
to
the
baby
he
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
then
he
bent
a
little
and
pressed
his
lips
to
enitchkas
hand
which
lay
white
as
milk
upon
ityas
little
red
smockikolai
etrovitch
what
are
you

she
whispered
dropping
her
eyes
then
slowly
raising
them
ery
charming
was
the
expression
of
her
eyes
when
she
peeped
as
it
were
from
under
her
lids
and
smiled
tenderly
and
a
little
foolishlyikolai
etrovitch
had
made
enitchkas
acquaintance
in
the
following
manner
e
had
once
happened
three
years
before
to
stay
a
night
at
an
inn
in
a
remote
district
town
e
was
agreeably
struck
by
the
cleanness
of
the
room
assigned
to
him
the
freshness
of
the
bedlinen
urely
the
woman
of
the
house
must
be
a
erman
was
the
idea
that
occurred
to
him
but
she
proved
to
be
a
ussian
a
woman
of
about
fifty
neatly
dressed
of
a
goodlooking
sensible
countenance
and
discreet
speech
e
entered
into
conversation
with
her
at
tea
he
liked
her
very
much
ikolai
etrovitch
had
at
that
time
only
just
moved
into
his
new
home
and
not
wishing
to
keep
serfs
in
the
house
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
wageservants
the
woman
of
the
inn
on
her
side
complained
of
the
small
number
of
visitors
to
the
town
and
the
hard
times
he
proposed
to
her
to
come
into
his
house
in
the
capacity
of
housekeeper
she
consented
er
husband
had
long
been
dead
leaving
her
an
only
daughter
enitchka
ithin
a
fortnight
rina
avishna
that
was
the
new
housekeepers
name
arrived
with
her
daughter
at
aryino
and
installed
herself
in
the
little
lodge
ikolai
etrovitchs
choice
proved
a
successful
one
rina
brought
order
into
the
household
s
for
enitchka
who
was
at
that
time
seventeen
no
one
spoke
of
her
and
scarcely
any
one
saw
her
she
lived
quietly
and
sedately
and
only
on
undays
ikolai
etrovitch
noticed
in
the
church
somewhere
in
a
side
place
the
delicate
profile
of
her
white
face
ore
than
a
year
passed
thusne
morning
rina
came
into
his
study
and
bowing
low
as
usual
she
asked
him
if
he
could
do
anything
for
her
daughter
who
had
got
a
spark
from
the
stove
in
her
eye
ikolai
etrovitch
like
all
stayathome
people
had
studied
doctoring
and
even
compiled
a
homoeopathic
guide
e
at
once
told
rina
to
bring
the
patient
to
him
enitchka
was
much
frightened
when
she
heard
the
master
had
sent
for
her
however
she
followed
her
mother
ikolai
etrovitch
led
her
to
the
window
and
took
her
head
in
his
two
hands
fter
thoroughly
examining
her
red
and
swollen
eye
he
prescribed
a
fomentation
which
he
made
up
himself
at
once
and
tearing
his
handkerchief
in
pieces
he
showed
her
how
it
ought
to
be
applied
enitchka
listened
to
all
he
had
to
say
and
then
was
going
iss
the
masters
hand
silly
girl
said
rina
ikolai
etrovitch
did
not
give
her
his
hand
and
in
confusion
himself
kissed
her
bent
head
on
the
parting
of
her
hair
enitchkas
eye
was
soon
well
again
but
the
impression
she
had
made
on
ikolai
etrovitch
did
not
pass
away
so
quickly
e
was
for
ever
haunted
by
that
pure
delicate
timidly
raised
face
he
felt
on
the
palms
of
his
hands
that
soft
hair
and
saw
those
innocent
slightly
parted
lips
through
which
pearly
teeth
gleamed
with
moist
brilliance
in
the
sunshine
e
began
to
watch
her
with
great
attention
in
church
and
tried
to
get
into
conversation
with
her
t
first
she
was
shy
of
him
and
one
day
meeting
him
at
the
approach
of
evening
in
a
narrow
footpath
through
a
field
of
rye
she
ran
into
the
tall
thick
rye
overgrown
with
cornflowers
and
wormwood
so
as
not
to
meet
him
face
to
face
e
caught
sight
of
her
little
head
through
a
golden
network
of
ears
of
rye
from
which
she
was
peeping
out
like
a
little
animal
and
called
affectionately
to
heroodevening
enitchka
dont
biteoodevening
she
whispered
not
coming
out
of
her
ambushy
degrees
she
began
to
be
more
at
home
with
him
but
was
still
shy
in
his
presence
when
suddenly
her
mother
rina
died
of
cholera
hat
was
to
become
of
enitchka
he
inherited
from
her
mother
a
love
for
order
regularity
and
respectability
but
she
was
so
young
so
alone
ikolai
etrovitch
was
himself
so
good
and
considerate
ts
needless
to
relate
the
resto
my
brother
came
in
to
see
you
ikolai
etrovitch
questioned
her
e
knocked
and
came
inesell
thats
a
good
thing
et
me
give
itya
a
swingnd
ikolai
etrovitch
began
tossing
him
almost
up
to
the
ceiling
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
baby
and
to
the
considerable
uneasiness
of
the
mother
who
every
time
he
flew
up
stretched
her
arms
up
towards
his
little
bare
legsavel
etrovitch
went
back
to
his
artistic
study
with
its
walls
covered
with
handsome
bluishgrey
hangings
with
weapons
hanging
upon
a
variegated
ersian
rug
nailed
to
the
wall
with
walnut
furniture
upholstered
in
dark
green
velveteen
with
a
renaissance
bookcase
of
old
black
oak
with
bronze
statuettes
on
the
magnificent
writingtable
with
an
open
hearth
e
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
remained
without
moving
looking
with
a
face
almost
of
despair
at
the
ceiling
hether
he
wanted
to
hide
from
the
very
walls
that
which
was
reflected
in
his
face
or
for
some
other
reason
he
got
up
drew
the
heavy
window
curtains
and
again
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
n
the
same
day
azarov
made
acquaintance
with
enitchka
e
was
walking
with
rkady
in
the
garden
and
explaining
to
him
why
some
of
the
trees
especially
the
oaks
had
not
done
wellou
ought
to
have
planted
silver
poplars
here
by
preference
and
spruce
firs
and
perhaps
limes
giving
them
some
loam

arbour
there

added

begin
to

with
my

remarked
rkady
you
certainly
have
a
poor
opinion
of

though
that
mattered
he
only
good
point
in
a
ussian
is
his
having
the
lowest
possible
opinion
of
himself
hat
does

is
that
two
and
two
make

and
the
rest
is
all
foolerynd
is

foolery
said
rkady
looking
pensively
at
the
brightcoloured
fields
in
the
distance
in
the
beautiful
soft
light
of
the
sun
which
was
not
yet

up

foolery
in
the
sense
you

atures
not

a

and
mans
the

in
itt
that
instant
the
long
drawn
notes
of
a
violoncello
floated
out
to
them
from
the
house
ome
one
was
playing
chuberts

with
much
feeling
though
with
an
untrained
hand
and
the
melody
flowed
with
honey

burst
into

went
on
laughing
but
much
as
he
revered
his
master
this
time
rkady
did
not
even
smile
bout
a
fortnight
passed
by
ife
at
aryino
went
on
its
accustomed
course
while
rkady
was
lazy
and
enjoyed
himself
and
azarov
worked
very
one
in
the
house
had
grown
used
to
him
to
his
careless
manners
and
his
curt
and
abrupt
speeches
enitchka
in
particular
was
so
far
at
home
with
him
that
one
night
she
sent
to
wake
him
up
itya
had
had
convulsions
and
he
had
gone
and
half
joking
halfyawning
as
usual
he
stayed
two
hours
with
her
and
relieved
the
child
n
the
other
hand
avel
etrovitch
had
grown
to
detest
azarov
with
all
the
strength
of
his
soul
he
regarded
him
as
stuckup
impudent
cynical
and
vulgar
he
suspected
that
azarov
had
no
respect
for
him
that
he
had
all
but
a
contempt
for
himhim
avel
irsanovikolai
etrovitch
was
rather
afraid
of
the
young
nihilist
and
was
doubtful
whether
his
influence
over
rkady
was
for
the
good
but
he
was
glad
to
listen
to
him
and
was
glad
to
be
present
at
his
scientific
and
chemical
experiments
azarov
had
brought
with
him
a
microscope
and
busied
himself
for
hours
together
with
it
he
servants
too
took
to
him
though
he
made
fun
of
them
they
felt
all
the
same
that
he
was
one
of
themselves
not
a
master
unyasha
was
always
ready
to
giggle
with
him
and
used
to
cast
significant
and
stealthy
glances
at
him
when
she
skipped
by
like
a
rabbit
iotr
a
man
vain
and
stupid
to
the
last
degree
for
ever
wearing
an
affected
frown
on
his
brow
a
man
whose
whole
merit
consisted
in
the
fact
that
he
looked
civil
could
spell
out
a
page
of
reading
and
was
diligent
in
brushing
his
coateven
he
smirked
and
brightened
up
directly
azarov
paid
him
any
attention
the
boys
on
the
farm
simply
ran
after
the
doctor
like
puppies
he
old
man
rokofitch
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
like
him
he
handed
him
the
dishes
at
table
with
a
surly
face
called
him
a
butcher
and
an
upstart
and
declared
that
with
his
great
whiskers
he
looked
like
a
pig
in
a
stye
rokofitch
in
his
own
way
was
quite
as
much
of
an
aristocrat
as
avel
etrovitchhe
best
days
of
the
year
had
comethe
first
days
of
une
he
weather
kept
splendidly
fine
in
the
distance
it
is
true
the
cholera
was
threatening
but
the
inhabitants
of
that
province
had
had
time
to
get
used
to
its
visits
azarov
used
to
get
up
very
early
and
go
out
for
two
or
three
miles
not
for
a
walkhe
couldnt
bear
walking
without
an
objectbut
to
collect
specimens
of
plants
and
insects
ometimes
he
took
rkady
with
himn
the
way
home
an
argument
usually
sprang
up
and
rkady
was
usually
vanquished
in
it
though
he
said
more
than
his
companionne
day
they
had
lingered
rather
late
ikolai
etrovitch
went
to
meet
them
in
the
garden
and
as
he
reached
the
arbour
he
suddenly
heard
the
quick
steps
and
voices
of
the
two
young
men
hey
were
walking
on
the
other
side
of
the
arbour
and
could
not
see
himou
dont
know
my
father
well
enough
said
rkadyour

a
nice
chap
said
azarov
but
hes

etrovitch

intently
rkady
made
no

whose
day
was
done
remained
two
minutes
motionless
and
stole
slowly
homehe

before

azarov
was
continuing
meanwhile
xplain
to
him
please
that
thats
no
earthly
use
es
not
a
boy
you
know
its
time
to
throw
up
that
rubbish
nd
what

be
a
romantic
at

etrovitch
said
the

day
after

to
his
brother
as
he
sat
in
his
study
you
and
are
behind
the
times
our
days
over
ell
well
erhaps
azarov
is
right
but
one
thing
confess
makes
me
feel
sore
did
so
hope
precisely
now
to
get
on
to
such
close
intimate
terms
with
rkady
and
it
turns
out
m
left
behind
and
he
has
gone
forward
and
we
cant
understand
one
anotherow
has
he
gone
forward
nd
in
what
way
is
he
so
superior
to
us
already
cried
avel
etrovitch
impatiently
ts
that
high
and
mighty
gentleman
that
nihilist
whos
knocked
all
that
into
his
head
hate
that
doctor
fellow
in
my
opinion
hes
simply
a
quack
m
convinced
for
all
his
tadpoles
hes
not
got
very
far
even
in
medicineo
brother
you
mustnt
say
that
azarov
is
clever
and
knows
his
subjectnd
his
conceits
something
revolting
avel
etrovitch
broke
in
againes
observed
ikolai
etrovitch

up

without

with

a

compassion
on

as
gently
as

remarked
ikolai
etrovitch
with
a
sighell
m
not
going
to
give
in
quite
so
soon
muttered
his
brother
ve
got
a
tussle
with
that
doctor
fellow
before
me
feel
sure
of
that
tussle
came
off
that
same
day
at
evening
tea
avel
etrovitch
came
into
the
drawingroom
all
ready
for
the
fray
irritable
and
determined
e
was
only
waiting
for
an
excuse
to
fall
upon
the
enemy
but
for
a
long
while
an
excuse
did
not
present
itself
s
a
rule
azarov
said
little
in
the
presence
of
the
old
irsanovs
that
was
how
he
spoke
of
the
brothers
and
that
evening
he
felt
out
of
humour
and
drank
off
cup
after
cup
of
tea
without
a
word
avel
etrovitch
was
all
aflame
with
impatience
his
wishes
were
fulfilled
at
lasthe
conversation
turned
on
one
of
the
neighbouring
landowners
otten
aristocratic
snob
observed
azarov
indifferently
e
had
met
him
in
etersburgllow
me
to
ask
you
began
avel
etrovitch
and
his
lips
were
trembling
according
to
your
ideas
have
the
words
rotten
and
aristocrat
the
same
meaning
said
aristocratic
snob
replied
azarov
lazily
swallowing
a
sip
of
tearecisely
so
but
imagine
you
have
the
same
opinion
of
aristocrats
as
of
aristocratic
snobs
think
it
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
do
not
share
that
opinion
venture
to
assert
that
every
one
knows
me
for
a
man
of
liberal
ideas
and
devoted
to
progress
but
exactly
for
that
reason
respect
aristocratsreal
aristocrats
indly
remember
sir
at
these
words
azarov
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
at
avel
etrovitch
kindly
remember
sir
he
repeated
with
acrimonythe
nglish
aristocracy
hey
do
not
abate
one
iota
of
their
rights
and
for
that
reason
they
respect
the
rights
of
others
they
demand
the
performance
of
what
is
due
to
them
and
for
that
reason
they
perform
their
own
duties
he
aristocracy
has
given
freedom
to
ngland
and
maintains
it
for
hereve
heard
that
story
a
good
many
times
replied
azarov
but
what
are
you
trying
to
prove
by
that
am
tryin
to
prove
by
that
sir
when
avel
etrovitch
was
angry
he
intentionally
clipped
his
words
in
this
way
though
of
course
he
knew
very
well
that
such
forms
are
not
strictly
grammatical
n
this
fashionable
whim
could
be
discerned
a
survival
of
the
habits
of
the
times
of
lexander
he
exquisites
of
those
days
on
the
rare
occasions
when
they
spoke
their
own
language
made
use
of
such
slipshod
forms
as
much
as
to
say
e
of
course
are
born
ussians
at
the
same
time
we
are
great
swells
who
are
at
liberty
to
neglect
the
rules
of
scholars
am
tryin
to
prove
by
that
sir
that
without
the
sense
of
personal
dignity
without
selfrespectand
these
two
sentiments
are
well
developed
in
the
aristocratthere
is
no
secure
foundation
for
the
social
bien
public
the
social
fabric
ersonal
character
sirthat
is
the
chief
thing
a
mans
personal
character
must
be
firm
as
a
rock
since
everything
is
built
on
it
am
very
well
aware
for
instance
that
you
are
pleased
to
consider
my
habits
my
dress
my
refinements
in
fact
ridiculous
but
all
that
proceeds
from
a
sense
of
selfrespect
from
a
sense
of
dutyyes
indeed
of
duty
live
in
the
country
in
the
wilds
but
will
not
lower
myself
respect
the
dignity
of
man
in
myselfet
me
ask
you
avel
etrovitch
commented
azarov
you
respect
yourself
and
sit
with
your
hands
folded
what
sort
of
benefit
does
that
do
to
the
bien
public
f
you
didnt
respect
yourself
youd
do
just
the
sameavel
etrovitch
turned
white
hats
a
different
question
ts
absolutely
unnecessary
for
me
to
explain
to
you
now
why
sit
with
folded
hands
as
you
are
pleased
to
express
yourself
wish
only
to
tell
you
that
aristocracy
is
a
principle
and
in
our
days
none
but
immoral
or
silly
people
can
live
without
principles
said
that
to
rkady
the
day
after
he
came
home
and
repeat
it
now
snt
it
so
ikolaiikolai
etrovitch
nodded
his
headristocracy

azarov
was
saying
meanwhile
if
you
think
of
it
what

of
foreign
and
useless
words
o
a
ussian
theyre
good
for
nothinghat
is

etrovitch
raised
his

in
horror

after

the

dont
understand
how
its
possible
not

of

repeated
azarov
with
indescribable
composureavel
etrovitch
stared
at
him
e
had
not
expected
this
while
rkady
fairly
blushed
with
delightllow
me
though
began
ikolai
etrovitch
ou
deny
everything
or
speaking
more
precisely
you
destroy
everything
ut
one
must
construct
too
you
knowhats
not
our
business
now
he

rkady
with

we
are
bound
to
carry
out
these
requirements
we
have
no
right
to
yield
to
the
satisfaction
of
our
personal
egoismhis
last
phrase
obviously
displeased
azarov
there
was
a
flavour
of
philosophy
that
is
to
say
romanticism
about
it
for
azarov
called
philosophy
too
romanticism
but
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
correct
his
young
discipleo
no
cried
avel
etrovitch
with
sudden
energy
m
not
willing
to
believe
that
you
young
men
know
the
ussian
people
really
that
you
are
the
representatives
of
their
requirements
their
efforts
o
the
ussian
people

with
the
confidence
of
a
practised
chessplayer
who
has
foreseen
an
apparently
dangerous
move
on

of
his

getting
upavel
etrovitch
smiled
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
brothers
shoulder
forced
him
to
sit
down
againont
be
uneasy
he
said
shall
not
forget
myself
just
through
that
sense
of
dignity
which
is
made
fun
of
so
mercilessly
by
our
friendour
friend
the
doctor
et
me
ask
he
resumed
turning
again
to
azarov
you
suppose
possibly
that
your
doctrine
is
a
novelty
hat
is
quite
a
mistake
he
materialism
you
advocate
has
been
more
than
once
in
vogue
already
and
has
always
proved
insufficient
foreign
word
again
broke
in
azarov
e
was
beginning
to
feel
vicious
and
his
face
assumed
a
peculiar
coarse
coppery
hue
n
the
first
place
we
advocate
nothing
thats
not
our
wayhat
do
you
do
thenll
tell
you
what
we
do
ot
long
ago
we
used
to
say
that
our
officials
took
bribes
that
we
had
no
roads
no
commerce
no
real
justice
h
see
you
are
reformersthats
what
thats
called
fancy
too
should
agree
to
many
of
your
reforms
but
hen
we
suspected
that
talk
perpetual
talk
and
nothing
but
talk
about
our
social
diseases
was
not
worth
while
that
it
all
led
to
nothing
but
superficiality
and
pedantry
we
saw
that
our
leading
men
socalled
advanced
people
and
reformers
are
no
good
that
we
busy
ourselves
over
foolery
talk
rubbish
about
art
unconscious
creativeness
parliamentarism
trial
by
jury
and
the
deuce
knows
what
all
while
all
the
while
its
a
question
of
getting
bread
to
eat
while
were
stifling
under
the
grossest
superstition
while
all
our
enterprises
come
to
grief
simply
because
there
arent
honest
men
enough
to
carry
them
on
while
the
very
emancipation
our
overnments
busy
upon
will
hardly
come
to
any
good
because
peasants
are
glad
to
rob
even
themselves
to
get
drunk
at

this
and

grimly

rkady
turned
away
and

nd
this

has
spread

already
have
been
told
that
in

our

never
set

in

they
regard
as
almost
a
fool
because
if
you
please
hes
an

while
theyre
all

most
disgustingly
sterile
and
unsuccessful

fellows
to

are

my
mind
retorted
azarov
aphaels
not

farthing
and
theyre
no
better
than
heravo
bravo
isten
rkady
thats
how
young
men
of
today
ought
to
express
themselves
nd
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
how
could
they
fail
to
follow
you
n
old
days
young
men
had
to
study
they
didnt
want
to
be
called
dunces
so
they
had
to
work
hard
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
ut
now
they
need
only
say
verything
in
the
world
is
foolery
and
the
tricks
done
oung
men
are
delighted
nd
to
be
sure
they
were
simply
geese
before
and
now
they
have
suddenly
turned
nihilistsour
praiseworthy
sense
of
personal
dignity
has
given
way
remarked
azarov
phlegmatically
while
rkady
was
hot
all
over
and
his
eyes
were
flashing
ur
argument
has
gone
too
far
its
better
to
cut
it
short
think
shall
be
quite
ready
to
agree
with
you
he
added
getting
up
when
you
bring
forward
a
single
institution
in
our
present
mode
of
life
in
family
or
in
social
life
which
does
not
call
for
complete
and
unqualified
destruction
will
bring
forward
millions
of
such
institutions
cried
avel
etrovitchmillions
ellthe
ir
for

cold
smile
curved
azarovs
lips
ell
as
regards
the
ir
he
commented
you
had
better
talk
to
your
brother
e
has
seen
by
now
should
fancy
what
sort
of

the
ir
is
in

sobriety
and
other
features
of
the
kindhe
family
then
the
family
as
it
exists
among
our
peasants
cried
avel
etrovitchnd
that
subject
too
imagine
it
will
be
better
for
yourselves
not
to
go
into
in
detail
ont
you
realise
all
the
advantages
of
the
head
of
the
family
choosing
his
daughtersinlaw
ake
my
advice
avel
etrovitch
allow
yourself
two
days
to
think
about
it
youre
not
likely
to
find
anything
on
the
spot
o
through
all
our
classes
and
think
well
over
each
while
and
rkady
will
ill
go
on
turning
everything
into
ridicule
broke
in

will
go
on

rkady
goodbye
for
the
present
gentlemenhe
two
friends
walked
off
he
brothers
were
left
alone
and
at
first
they
only
looked
at
one
anothero
that
began
avel
etrovitch
so
thats
what
our
young
men
of
this
generation
are
hey
are
like
thatour
successorsur
successors
repeated
ikolai
etrovitch
with
a
dejected
smile
e
had
been
sitting
on
thorns
all
through
the
argument
and
had
done
nothing
but
glance
stealthily
with
a
sore
heart
at
rkady
o
you
know
what
was
reminded
of
brother
once
had
a
dispute
with
our
poor
mother
she
stormed
and
wouldnt
listen
to
me
t
last
said
to
her
f
course
you
cant
understand
me
we
belong
said
to
two
different
generations
he
was
dreadfully
offended
while
thought
heres
no
help
for
it
ts
a
bitter
pill
but
she
has
to
swallow
it
ou
see
now
our
turn
has
come
and
our
successors
can
say
to
us
ou
are
not
of
our
generation
swallow
your
pillou
are
beyond
everything
in
your
generosity
and
modesty
replied
avel
etrovitch
m
convinced
on
the
contrary
that
you
and
are
far
more
in
the
right
than
these
young
gentlemen
though
we
do
perhaps
express
ourselves
in
oldfashioned
language
vieilli
and
have
not
the
same
insolent
conceit
nd
the
swagger
of
the
young
men
nowadays
ou
ask
one
o
you
take
red
wine
or
white
t
is
my
custom
to
prefer
red

answers
in
a
deep
bass
with
a
face
as
solemn
as
if
the
whole
universe
had
its
eyes
on
him
at
that
instanto
you
care
for
any
more
tea
asked
enitchka
putting
her
head
in
at
the
door
she
had
not
been
able
to
make
up
her
mind
to
come
into
the
drawingroom
while
there
was
the
sound
of
voices
in
dispute
thereo
you
can
tell
them
to
take
the
samovar
answered
ikolai
etrovitch
and
he
got
up
to
meet
her
avel
etrovitch
said
bon
soir
to
him
abruptly
and
went
away
to
his
study
alf
an
hour
later
ikolai
etrovitch
went
into
the
garden
to
his
favourite
arbour
e
was
overtaken
by
melancholy
thoughts
or
the
first
time
he
realised
clearly
the
distance
between
him
and
his
son
he
foresaw
that
every
day
it
would
grow
wider
and
wider
n
vain
then
had
he
spent
whole
days
sometimes
in
the
winter
at
etersburg
over
the
newest
books
in
vain
had
he
listened
to
the
talk
of
the
young
men
in
vain
had
he
rejoiced
when
he
succeeded
in
putting
in
his
word
too
in
their
heated
discussions
y
brother
says
we
are
right
he
thought
and
apart
from
all
vanity
do
think
myself
that
they
are
further
from
the
truth
than
we
are
though
at
the
same
time
feel
there
is
something
behind
them
we
have
not
got
some
superiority
over
us
s
it
youth
o
not
only
youth
oesnt
their
superiority
consist
in
there
being
fewer
traces
of
the
slaveowner
in
them
than
in
usikolai
etrovitchs
head
sank
despondently
and
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
faceut
to
renounce
poetry
he
thought
again
to
have
no
feeling
for
art
for
nature
nd
he
looked
round
as
though
trying
to
understand
how
it
was
possible
to
have
no
feeling
for
nature
t
was
already
evening
the
sun
was
hidden
behind
a
small
copse
of
aspens
which
lay
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
garden
its
shadow
stretched
indefinitely
across
the
still
fields
peasant
on
a
white
nag
went
at
a
trot
along
the
dark
narrow
path
close
beside
the
copse
his
whole
figure
was
clearly
visible
even
to
the
patch
on
his
shoulder
in
spite
of
his
being
in
the
shade
the
horses
hoofs
flew
along
bravely
he
suns
rays
from
the
farther
side
fell
full
on
the
copse
and
piercing
through
its
thickets
threw
such
a
warm
light
on
the
aspen
trunks
that
they
looked
like
pines
and
their
leaves
were
almost
a
dark
blue
while
above
them
rose
a
pale
blue
sky
faintly
tinged
by
the
glow
of
sunset
he
swallows
flew
high
the
wind
had
quite
died
away
belated
bees
hummed
slowly
and
drowsily
among
the
lilac
blossom
a
swarm
of
midges
hung
like
a
cloud
over
a
solitary
branch
which
stood
out
against
the
sky
ow
beautiful
my
od
thought
ikolai
etrovitch
and
his
favourite
verses
were
almost
on
his
lips
he
remembered
rkadys
toff
und
raftand
was
silent
but
still
he
sat
there
still
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
sorrowful
consolation
of
solitary
thought
e
was
fond
of
dreaming
his
country
life
had
developed
the
tendency
in
him
ow
short
a
time
ago
he
had
been
dreaming
like
this
waiting
for
his
son
at
the
posting
station
and
what
a
change
already
since
that
day
their
relations
that
were
then
undefined
were
defined
nowand
how
defined
gain
his
dead
wife
came
back
to
his
imagination
but
not
as
he
had
known
her
for
many
years
not
as
the
good
domestic
housewife
but
as
a
young
girl
with
a
slim
figure
innocently
inquiring
eyes
and
a
tight
twist
of
hair
on
her
childish
neck
e
remembered
how
he
had
seen
her
for
the
first
time
e
was
still
a
student
then
e
had
met
her
on
the
staircase
of
his
lodgings
and
jostling
by
accident
against
her
he
tried
to
apologise
and
could
only
mutter
ardon
monsieur
while
she
bowed
smiled
and
suddenly
seemed
frightened
and
ran
away
though
at
the
bend
of
the
staircase
she
had
glanced
rapidly
at
him
assumed
a
serious
air
and
blushed
fterwards
the
first
timid
visits
the
halfwords
the
halfsmiles
and
embarrassment
and
melancholy
and
yearnings
and
at
last
that
breathing
rapture
here
had
it
all
vanished
he
had
been
his
wife
he
had
been
happy
as
few
on
earth
are
happy
ut
he
mused
these
sweet
first
moments
why
could
one
not
live
an
eternal
undying
life
in
theme
did
not
try
to
make
his
thought
clear
to
himself
but
he
felt
that
he
longed
to
keep
that
blissful
time
by
something
stronger
than
memory
he
longed
to
feel
his
arya
near
him
again
to
have
the
sense
of
her
warmth
and
breathing
and
already
he
could
fancy
that
over
himikolai
etrovitch
came
the
sound
of
enitchkas
voice
close
by
him
where
are
youe
started
e
felt
no
pang
no
shame
e
never
even
admitted
the
possibility
of
comparison
between
his
wife
and
enitchka
but
he
was
sorry
she
had
thought
of
coming
to
look
for
him
er
voice
had
brought
back
to
him
at
once
his
grey
hairs
his
age
his
realityhe
enchanted
world
into
which
he
was
just
stepping
which
was
just
rising
out
of
the
dim
mists
of
the
past

shakenand
vanishedm
here
he
answered
m
coming
run
along
here
it
is
the
traces
of
the
slave
owner
flashed
through
his
mind
enitchka
peeped
into
the
arbour
at
him
without
speaking
and
disappeared
while
he
noticed
with
astonishment
that
the
night
had
come
on
while
he
had
been
dreaming
verything
around
was
dark
and
hushed
enitchkas
face
had
glimmered
so
pale
and
slight
before
him
e
got
up
and
was
about
to
go
home
but
the
emotion
stirred
in
his
heart
could
not
be
soothed
at
once
and
he
began
slowly
walking
about
the
garden
sometimes
looking
at
the
ground
at
his
feet
and
then
raising
his
eyes
towards
the
sky
where
swarms
of
stars
were
twinkling
e
walked
a
great
deal
till
he
was
almost
tired
out
while
the
restlessness
within
him
a
kind
of
yearning
vague
melancholy
restlessness
still
was
not
appeased
h
how
azarov
would
have
laughed
at
him
if
he
had
known
what
was
passing
within
him
then
rkady
himself
would
have
condemned
him
e
a
man
fortyfour
years
old
an
agriculturist
and
a
farmer
was
shedding
tears
causeless
tears
this
was
a
hundred
times
worse
than
the
violoncelloikolai
etrovitch
continued
walking
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
into
the
house
into
the
snug
peaceful
nest
which
looked
out
at
him
so
hospitably
from
all
its
lighted
windows
he
had
not
the
force
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
darkness
the
garden
the
sense
of
the
fresh
air
in
his
face
from
that
melancholy
that
restless
cravingt
a
turn
in
the
path
he
was
met
by

hats
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
ikolai
etrovitch
you
are
as
white
as
a
ghost
you
are
not
well
why
dont
you
go
to
bedikolai
etrovitch
explained
to
him
briefly
his
state
of
feeling
and
moved
away
avel
etrovitch
went
to
the
end
of
the
garden
and
he
too
grew
thoughtful
and
he
too
raised
his
eyes
toward
the
heavens
ut
in
his
beautiful
dark
eyes
nothing
was
reflected
but
the
light
of
the
stars
e
was
not
born
an
idealist
and
his
fastidiously
dry
and
sensuous
soul
with
its
rench
tinge
of
cynicism
was
not
capable
of
dreamingo
you
know
what
azarov
was
saying
to
rkady
the
same
night

got
a
splendid
idea

father

we

observed
rkady
languidlyn
his
heart
he
was
highly
delighted
with
his
friends
suggestion
but
he
thought
it
a
duty
to
conceal
his
feeling
e
was
not
a
nihilist
for
nothinghe
next
day
he
set
off
with
azarov
to
he
younger
part
of
the
household
at
aryino
were
sorry
at
their
going
unyasha
even
cried
but
the
old
folks
breathed
more
easily
he
town
of
to
which
our
friends
set
off
was
in
the
jurisdiction
of
a
governor
who
was
a
young
man
and
at
once
a
progressive
and
a
despot
as
often
happens
with
ussians
efore
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
his
government
he
had
managed
to
quarrel
not
only
with
the
marshal
of
nobility
a
retired
officer
of
the
guards
who
kept
open
house
and
a
stud
of
horses
but
even
with
his
own
subordinates
he
feuds
arising
from
this
cause
assumed
at
last
such
proportions
that
the
ministry
in
etersburg
had
found
it
necessary
to
send
down
a
trusted
personage
with
a
commission
to
investigate
it
all
on
the
spot
he
choice
of
the
authorities
fell
upon
atvy
lyitch
olyazin
the
son
of
the
olyazin
under
whose
protection
the
brothers
irsanov
had
once
found
themselves
e
too
was
a
young
man
that
is
to
say
he
had
not
long
passed
forty
but
he
was
already
on
the
high
road
to
becoming
a
statesman
and
wore
a
star
on
each
side
of
his
breastone
to
be
sure
a
foreign
star
not
of
the
first
magnitude
ike
the
governor
whom
he
had
come
down
to
pass
judgment
upon
he
was
reckoned
a
progressive
and
though
he
was
already
a
bigwig
he
was
not
like
the
majority
of
bigwigs
e
had
the
highest
opinion
of
himself
his
vanity
knew
no
bounds
but
he
behaved
simply
looked
affable
listened
condescendingly
and
laughed
so
goodnaturedly
that
on
a
first
acquaintance
he
might
even
be
taken
for
a
jolly
good
fellow
n
important
occasions
however
he
knew
as
the
saying
is
how
to
make
his
authority
felt
nergy
is
essential
he
used
to
say
then
lnergie
est
la
premire
qualit
dun
homme
dtat
and
for
all
that
he
was
usually
taken
in
and
any
moderately
experienced
official
could
turn
him
round
his
finger
atvy
lyitch
used
to
speak
with
great
respect
of
uizot
and
tried
to
impress
every
one
with
the
idea
that
he
did
not
belong
to
the
class
of
routiniers
and
highanddry
bureaucrats
that
not
a
single
phenomenon
of
social
life
passed
unnoticed
by
him
ll
such
phrases
were
very
familiar
to
him
e
even
followed
with
dignified
indifference
it
is
true
the
development
of
contemporary
literature
so
a
grownup
man
who
meets
a
procession
of
small
boys
in
the
street
will
sometimes
walk
after
it
n
reality
atvy
lyitch
had
not
got
much
beyond
those
political
men
of
the
days
of
lexander
who
used
to
prepare
for
an
evening
party
at
adame
vyetchins
by
reading
a
page
of
ondillac
only
his
methods
were
different
more
modern
e
was
an
adroit
courtier
a
great
hypocrite
and
nothing
more
he
had
no
special
aptitude
for
affairs
and
no
intellect
but
he
knew
how
to
manage
his
own
business
successfully
no
one
could
get
the
better
of
him
there
and
to
be
sure
thats
the
principal
thingatvy
lyitch
received
rkady
with
the
goodnature
we
might
even
call
it
playfulness
characteristic
of
the
enlightened
higher
official
e
was
astonished
however
when
he
heard
that
the
cousins
he
had
invited
had
remained
at
home
in
the
country
our
father
was
always
a
queer
fellow
he
remarked
playing
with
the
tassels
of
his
magnificent
velvet
dressinggown
and
suddenly
turning
to
a
young
official
in
a
discreetly
buttonedup
uniform
he
cried
with
an
air
of
concentrated
attention
hat
he
young
man
whose
lips
were
glued
together
from
prolonged
silence
got
up
and
looked
in
perplexity
at
his
chief
ut
having
nonplussed
his
subordinate
atvy
lyitch
paid
him
no
further
attention
ur
higher
officials
are
fond
as
a
rule
of
nonplussing
their
subordinates
the
methods
to
which
they
have
recourse
to
attain
that
end
are
rather
various
he
following

among
others
is
in
great
vogue
is
quite
a
favourite

in
an
everlasting
fuss
and
hurry
in
the
morning
he
used
to
put
on
a
tight
uniform
and
an
excessively
stiff
cravat
he
never
ate
or
drank
enough
he
was
for
ever
making
arrangements
e
invited
irsanov
and
azarov
to
his

and
within

few
minutes
invited

pleasant

wellgroomed

small

do
despise
them
fully
and
completely
he
possibility
of
feeling
and
expressing
contempt
was
the
most
agreeable
sensation
to
itnikov
he
used
to
attack
women
in
especial
never
suspecting
that
it
was
to
be
his
fate
a
few
months
later
to
be
cringing
before
his

discussion
upon
the
question
whether

whether

at

to
vdoksya
flushed
from

with

remarked
aloud
azarov
who
had
at
rare
intervals
put
in
an
ironical
word
in
the
conversationhe
paid
more
attention
to
the
champagnegave
a
loud
yawn
got
up
and
without
taking
leave
of
their
hostess
he
walked
off
with
rkady
itnikov
jumped
up
and
followed
themell
what
do
you
think
of
her
he
inquired
skipping
obsequiously
from
right
to
left
of
them
told
you
you
see
a
remarkable
personality
f
we
only
had
more
women
like
that
he
is
in
her

way
an
expression
of
the
highest
moralitynd
is
that
establishment
of
your
governors
an
expression
of
the
highest
morality
too
observed
azarov
pointing
to
a
ginshop
which
they
were
passing
at
that
instantitnikov
again
went
off
into
a
shrill
laugh
e
was
greatly
ashamed
of
his
origin
and
did
not
know
whether
to
feel
flattered
or
offended
at
azarovs
unexpected
familiarity
few
days
later
the
ball
at
the
overnors
took
place
atvy
lyitch
was
the
real
hero
of
the
occasion
he
marshal
of
nobility
declared
to
all
and
each
that
he
had
come
simply
out
of
respect
for
him
while
the
overnor
even
at
the
ball
even
while
he
remained
perfectly
motionless
was
still
making
arrangements
he
affability
of
atvy
lyitchs
demeanour
could
only
be
equalled
by
its
dignity
e
was
gracious
to
all
to
some
with
a
shade
of
disgust
to
others
with
a
shade
of
respect
he
was
all
bows
and
smiles
en
vrai
chevalier
franais
before
the
ladies
and
was
continually
giving
vent
to
a
hearty
sonorous
unshared
laugh
such
as
befits
a
high
official
e
slapped
rkady
on
the
back
and
called
him
loudly
nephew

azarovwho
was
attired
in
a
rather
old
evening
coata
sidelong
glance
in

but
condescendingand
an
indistinct
but
affable
grunt
in
which
nothing
could
be
distinguished
but
and
very
much
gave
itnikov
a
finger
and
a
smile
though
with
his
head
already
averted
even
to
adame
ukshin
who
made
her
appearance
at
the
ball
with
dirty
gloves
no
crinoline
and
a
bird
of
aradise
in
her
hair
he
said
enchant
here
were
crowds
of
people
and
no
lack
of
dancing
men
the
civilians
were
for
the
most
part
standing
close
along
the
walls
but
the
officers
danced
assiduously
especially
one
of
them
who
had
spent
six
weeks
in
aris
where
he
had
mastered
various
daring
interjections
of
the
kind
ofzut

and
such
e
pronounced
them
to
perfection
with
genuine

at
the

time

for
assuring
us
that
we

comme

as
we
are
aware
danced
badly
while
azarov
did
not
dance
at
all
they
both
took
up
their
position
in
a
corner
itnikov
joined
himself
on
to
them
with
an
expression
of
contemptuous
scorn
on
his
face
and
giving
vent
to
spiteful
comments
he
looked
insolently
about
him
and
seemed
to
be
really
enjoying
himself
uddenly
his
face
changed
and
turning
to
rkady
he
said
with
some
show
of
embarrassment
it
seemed
dintsova
is
hererkady
looked
round
and
saw
a
tall
woman
in
a
black
dress
standing
at
the
door
of
the
room
e
was
struck
by
the
dignity
of
her
carriage
er
bare
arms
lay
gracefully
beside
her
slender
waist
gracefully
some
light
sprays
of
fuchsia
drooped
from
her
shining
hair
on
to
her
sloping
shoulders
her
clear
eyes
looked
out
from
under
a
rather
overhanging
white
brow
with
a
tranquil
and
intelligent
expressiontranquil
it
was
precisely
not
pensiveand
on
her
lips
was
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
here
was
a
kind
of
gracious
and
gentle
force
about
her
faceo

her
rkady
asked

a

figure
he
remarked
ot
like
the
other
femalesfter
waiting
till
the
end
of
the
quadrille
itnikov
led
rkady
up
to
adame
dintsov
but
he
hardly
seemed
to
be
intimately
acquainted
with
her
he
was
embarrassed
in
his
sentences
while
she
looked
at
him
in
some
surprise
ut
her
face
assumed
an
expression
of
pleasure
when
she
heard
rkadys
surname
he
asked
him
whether
he
was
not
the
son
of
ikolai
etrovitches

seen
your
father
twice
and
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
him
she
went
on
am
glad
to
make
your
acquaintancet
that
instant
some
adjutant
flew
up
to
her
and
begged
for
a
quadrille
he
consentedo
you

then
asked
rkady
respectfullyes
dance
hy
do
you
suppose

dance
o
you
think

too
oldeally
how
could
possibly
ut
in
that
case
let
me
ask
you
for
a
mazurkaadame
dintsov
smiled
graciously
ertainly
she
said
and
she
looked
at
rkady
not
exactly
with
an
air
of
superiority
but
as
married
sisters
look
at
very
young
brothers
adame
dintsov
was
a
little
older
than
rkadyshe
was
twentyninebut
in
her
presence
he
felt
himself
a
schoolboy
a
little
student
so
that
the
difference
in
age
between
them
seemed
of
more
consequence
atvy
lyitch
approached
her
with
a
majestic
air
and
ingratiating
speeches
rkady
moved
away
but
he
still
watched
her
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
even
during
the
quadrille
he
talked
with
equal
ease
to
her
partner
and
to
the
grand
official
softly
turned
her
head
and
eyes
and
twice
laughed
softly
er
noselike
almost
all
ussian
noseswas
a
little
thick
and
her
complexion
was
not
perfectly
clear
rkady
made
up
his
mind
for
all
that
that
he
had
never
before
met
such
an
attractive
woman
e
could
not
get
the
sound
of
her
voice
out
of
his
ears
the
very
folds
of
her
dress
seemed
to
hang
upon
her
differently
from
all
the
restmore
gracefully
and
amplyand
her
movements
were
distinguished
by
a
peculiar
smoothness
and
naturalnessrkady
felt
some
timidity
in
his
heart
when
at
the
first
sounds
of
the
mazurka
he
began
to
sit
it
out
beside
his
partner
he
had
prepared
to
enter
into
a
conversation
with
her
but
he
only
passed
his
hand
through
his
hair
and
could
not
find
a
single
word
to
say
ut
his
timidity
and
agitation
did
not
last
long
adame
dintsovs
tranquillity
gained
upon
him
too
before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
he
was
telling
her
freely
about
his
father
his
uncle
his
life
in
etersburg
and
in
the
country
adame
dintsov
listened
to
him
with
courteous
sympathy
slightly
opening
and
closing
her
fan
his
talk
was
broken
off
when
partners
came
for
her
itnikov
among
others
twice
asked
her
he
came
back
sat
down
again
took
up
her
fan
and
her
bosom
did
not
even
heave
more
rapidly
while
rkady
fell
to
chattering
again
filled
through
and
through
by
the
happiness
of
being
near
her
talking
to
her
looking
at
her
eyes
her
lovely
brow
all
her
sweet
dignified
clever
face
he
said
little
but
her
words
showed
a
knowledge
of
life
from
some
of
her
observations
rkady
gathered
that
this
young
woman
had
already
felt
and
thought
muchho
is
that
you
were
standing
with
she
asked
him
when
r
itnikov
brought
you
to
meid
you
notice
him
rkady
asked
in
his
turn
e
has
a
splendid
face
hasnt
he
hats
azarov
my
friendrkady
fell
to
discussing
his
friend
e
spoke
of
him
in
such
detail
and
with
such
enthusiasm
that
adame
dintsov
turned
towards
him
and
looked
attentively
at
him
eanwhile
the
mazurka
was
drawing
to
a
close
rkady
felt
sorry
to
part
from
his
partner
he
had
spent
nearly
an
hour
so
happily
with
her
e
had
it
is
true
during
the
whole
time
continually
felt
as
though
she
were
condescending
to
him
as
though
he
ought
to
be
grateful
to
her
but
young
hearts
are
not
weighed
down
by
that
feelinghe
music

said
adame
dintsov

bow
to
rkady

bowed
low
looked
after
her
how
graceful
her
figure
seemed
to
him
draped
in
the
greyish
lustre
of
the
black
silk
and
thinking
his
minute
she
has
forgotten
my
existence
was
conscious
of
an
exquisite
humility
in
his
soulell
azarov
questioned
him
directly
he
had
gone
back
to
him
in
the
corner

ou

rkady

an
opinion
about
that
he
wishes
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
has
asked
me
to
bring
you

simply
a
provincial
lioness
or
advanced

of
shoulders
such
as
ve
not
set
eyes
on
for
a
long
whilerkady
was
wounded
by
azarovs
cynicism
butas
often
happenshe
reproached
his
friend
not
precisely
for
what
he
did
not
like
in
him
hy
are
you
unwilling
to
allow
freethinking
in
women
he
said
in
a
low
voiceecause
my
boy
as
far
as
my
observations
go
the
only
freethinkers
among
women
are
frightshe
conversation
was
cut
short
at
this
point
oth
the
young
men
went
away
immediately
after
supper
hey
were
pursued
by
a
nervously
malicious
but
somewhat
fainthearted
laugh
from
adame
ukshin
her
vanity
had
been
deeply
wounded
by
neither
of
them
having
paid
any
attention
to
her
he
stayed
later
than
any
one
at
the
ball
and
at
four
oclock
in
the
morning
she
was
dancing
a
polkamazurka
with
itnikov
in
the
arisian
style
his
edifying
spectacle
was
the
final
event
of
the
overnors
ball
ets
see
what
species
of
mammalia
this
specimen
belongs
to
azarov
said
to
rkady
the
following
day
as
they
mounted
the
staircase
of
the
hotel
in
which
adame
dintsov
was
staying
scent
out
something
wrong
herem
surprised
at
you
cried
rkady
hat
ou
you
azarov
clinging
to
the
narrow
morality
which
hat
a
funny
fellow
you
are
azarov
cut
him
short
carelessly
ont
you
know
that
something
wrong
means
something
right
in
my
dialect
and
for
me
ts
an
advantage
for
me
of
course
idnt
you
tell
me
yourself
this
morning
that
she
made
a
strange
marriage
though
to
my
mind
to
marry
a
rich
old
man
is
by
no
means
a
strange
thing
to
do
but
on
the
contrary
very
sensible
dont
believe
the
gossip
of
the
town
but
should
like
to
think
as
our
cultivated
overnor
says
that
its
wellgroundedrkady
made
no
answer
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
apartments
young
servant
in
livery
conducted
the
two
friends
in
to
a
large
room
badly
furnished
like
all
rooms
in
ussian
hotels
but
filled
with
flowers
oon
adame
dintsov
herself
appeared
in
a
simple
morning
dress
he
seemed
still
younger
by
the
light
of
the
spring
sunshine
rkady
presented
azarov
and
noticed
with
secret
amazement
that
he
seemed
embarrassed
while
adame
dintsov
remained
perfectly
tranquil
as
she
had
been
the
previous
day
azarov
himself
was
conscious
of
being
embarrassed
and
was
irritated
by
it
eres
a
gofrightened
of
a
petticoat
he
thought
and
lolling
quite
like
itnikov
in
an
easychair
he
began
talking
with
an
exaggerated
appearance
of
ease
while
adame
dintsov
kept
her
clear
eyes
fixed
on
himnna
ergyevna
dintsov
was
the
daughter
of
ergay
ikolaevitch
oktev
notorious
for
his
personal
beauty
his
speculations
and
his
gambling
propensities
who
after
cutting
a
figure
and
making
a
sensation
for
fifteen
years
in
etersburg
and
oscow
finished
by
ruining
himself
completely
at
cards
and
was
forced
to
retire
to
the
country
where
however
he
soon
after
died
leaving
a
very
small
property
to
his
two
daughtersnna
a
girl
of
twenty
and

a

died
at

when
her
husband
was
in
his
heydey
nnas
position
after
her
fathers
death
was
very
difficult
he
brilliant
education
she
had
received
in
etersburg
had
not
fitted
her
for
putting
up
with
the
cares
of
domestic
life
and
economyfor
an
obscure
existence
in
the
country
he
knew
positively
no
one
in
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
there
was
no
one
she
could
consult
er
father
had
tried
to
avoid
all
contact
with
the
neighbours
he
despised
them
in
his
way
and
they
despised
him
in
theirs
he
did
not
lose
her
head
however
and
promptly
sent
for
a
sister
of
her
mothers
rincess
vdotya
tepanovna
a
spiteful
and
arrogant
old
lady
who
on
installing
herself
in
her
nieces
house
appropriated
all
the
best
rooms
for
her
own
use
scolded
and
grumbled
from
morning
till
night
and
would
not
go
a
walk
even
in
the
garden
unattended
by
her
one
serf
a
surly
footman
in
a
threadbare
peagreen
livery
with
light
blue
trimming
and
a
threecornered
hat

put
up
patiently
with
all
her
aunts
whims
gradually
set
to
work
on
her
sisters
education
and
was
it
seemed
already
getting
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
wasting
her
life
in
the
wilds
ut
destiny
had
decreed
another
fate
for
her
he
chanced
to
be
seen
by
dintsov
a
very
wealthy
man
of
fortysix
an
eccentric
hypochondriac
stout
heavy
and
sour
but
not
stupid
and
not
illnatured
he
fell
in
love
with
her
and
offered
her
his
hand
he
consented
to
become
his
wife
and
he
lived
six
years
with
her
and
on
his
death
settled
all
his
property
upon
her
nna
ergyevna
remained
in
the
country
for
nearly
a
year
after
his
death
then
she
went
abroad
with
her
sister
but
only
stopped
in
ermany
she
got
tired
of
it
and
came
back
to
live
at
her
favourite
ikolskoe
which
was
nearly
thirty
miles
from
the
town
of
here
she
had
a
magnificent
splendidly
furnished
house
and
a
beautiful
garden
with
conservatories
her
late
husband
had
spared
no
expense
to
gratify
his
fancies
nna
ergyevna
went
very
rarely
to
the
town
generally
only
on
business
and
even
then
she
did
not
stay
long
he
was
not
liked
in
the
province
there
had
been
a
fearful
outcry
at
her
marriage
with
dintsov
all
sorts
of
fictions
were
told
about
her
it
was
asserted
that
she
had
helped
her
father
in
his
cardsharping
tricks
and
even
that
she
had
gone
abroad
for
excellent
reasons
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
conceal
the
lamentable
consequences
ou
understand
the
indignant
gossips
would
wind
up
he
has
gone
through
the
fire
was
said
of
her
to
which
a
noted
provincial
wit
usually
added
nd
through
all
the
other
elements
ll
this
talk
reached
her
but
she
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
it
there
was
much
independence
and
a
good
deal
of
determination
in
her
characteradame
dintsov
sat
leaning
back
in
her
easychair
and
listened
with
folded
hands
to
azarov
e
contrary
to
his
habit
was
talking
a
good
deal
and
obviously
trying
to
interest
heragain
a
surprise
for
rkady
e
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
azarov
was
attaining
his
object
t
was
difficult
to
conjecture
from
nna
ergyevnas
face
what
impression
was
being
made
on
her
it
retained
the
same
expression
gracious
and
refined
her
beautiful
eyes
were
lighted
up
by
attention
but
by
quiet
attention
azarovs
bad
manners
had
impressed
her
unpleasantly
for
the
first
minutes
of
the
visit
like
a
bad
smell
or
a
discordant
sound
but
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
nervous
and
that
even
flattered
her
othing
was
repulsive
to
her
but
vulgarity
and
no
one
could
have
accused
azarov
of
vulgarity
rkady
was
fated
to
meet
with
surprises
that
day
e
had
expected
that
azarov
would
talk
to
a
clever
woman
like
adame
dintsov
about
his
opinions
and
his
views
she
had
herself
expressed
a
desire
to
listen
to
the
man
who
dares
to
have
no
belief
in
anything
but
instead
of
that
azarov
talked
about
medicine
about
homoeopathy
and
about
botany
t
turned
out
that
adame
dintsov
had
not
wasted
her
time
in
solitude
she
had
read
a
good
many
excellent
books
and
spoke
herself
in
excellent
ussian
he
turned
the
conversation
upon
music
but
noticing
that
azarov
did
not
appreciate
art
she
quietly
brought
it
back
to
botany
even
though
rkady
was
just
launching
into
a
discourse
upon
the
significance
of
national
melodies
adame
dintsov
treated
him
as
though
he
were
a
younger
brother
she
seemed
to
appreciate
his
goodnature
and
youthful
simplicityand
that
was
all
or
over
three
hours
a
lively
conversation
was
kept
up
ranging
freely
over
various
subjectshe
friends
at
last
got
up
and
began
to
take
leave
nna
ergyevna
looked
cordially
at
them
held
out
her
beautiful
white
hand
to
both
and
after
a
moments
thought
said
with
a
doubtful
but
delightful
smile

a

in

built
in

style
as

led
the

with

to
a
special
room
in
which
two
bedsteads
were
already
prepared
for
them
with
all
necessaries
for
the
toilet
t
was
clear
that
order
reigned
supreme
in
the
house
everything
was
clean
everywhere
there
was
a
peculiar
delicate
fragrance
just
as
there

later
azarov
and
rkady
went
together
into
the
drawingroom

large
lofty

rather
luxuriously

without

good

in
the
ordinary
stiff
arrangement
along
the
walls
which
were
covered
with

a
sofa
in
the
centre
of

lighthaired
manand
it
seemed
to
look
with
displeasure
at
the
visitors
t

be
the
late
lamented
azarov
whispered
to
rkady
and
turning
up
his
nose
he
added

instant
the
lady

dintsov
delivered
all
this
little
speech
with
peculiar
precision
as
though
she
had
learned
it
by
heart
then
she
turned
to
rkady

appeared
that
her
mother
had
known
rkadys

and
had
even
been
her
confidante
in
her
love
for

looked
at
nna
ergyevna
erhaps
you
must
know
best
nd
so
you
are
inclined
for
a
discussionby
all
means
was
looking
through
the
views
of
the
axon
mountains
in
your
album
and
you
remarked
that
that
couldnt
interest
me
ou
said
so
because
you
suppose
me
to
have
no
feeling
for
art
and
as
a
fact
havent
any
but
these
views
might
be
interesting
to
me
from
a
geological
standpoint
for
the
formation
of
the
mountains
for
instancexcuse
me
but
as
a
geologist
you
would
sooner
have
recourse
to
a
book
to
a
special
work
on
the
subject
and
not
to
a

she
observed
putting

on

by
that

what

askell
at

menazarov
smiled
n
the
first
place
experience
of
life
does
that
and
in
the
second
assure
you
studying
separate
individuals
is
not
worth
the
trouble
ll
people
are
like
one
another
in
soul
as
in

each
of
us
has
brain

and
lungs
made
alike
and
the
socalled
moral
qualities
are
the
same
in
all
the
slight
variations
are
of
no
importance
single

is
sufficient
to
judge
of

birchtreeatya
who
was
arranging
the

one
at
a
time
in

leisurely
fashion
lifted
her
eyes
to
azarov
with
a
puzzled
look
and
meeting
his
rapid
and
careless
glance
she
crimsoned
up
to
her
ears
nna
ergyevna
shook

in

she
repeated
hen
according
to
you
there
is
no
difference
between
the
stupid
and
the
clever
person
between
the
goodnatured
and
illnaturedo
there
is
a
difference
just
as
between

the
healthy

what
physical

said
all
this
with
an
air
as

not
as

slowly
passed
his

over

his

strayed
about

you
conclude
observed
nna

that
when

is
reformed
there
will
be
no

any

in

in

when

she
sank
into

in
pouring
out

handed
her

a

emblazoned
with

he
old

put
some
honey
in

she
considered
it
both
sinful
and
extravagant
to
drink
tea
with
sugar
in
it
though
she
never
spent
a
farthing
herself
on
anything
and
suddenly
asked
in
a
hoarse
voice
nd
what
does

made
her

azarov
and
rkady
soon
guessed
that
they
paid

they
treated

respectfullyecause

thought
azarovfter

nna
ergyevna
suggested
they
should
go
out
for

but
it
began
to
rain
a
little
and
the
whole
party
with
the
exception
of
the

returned
to

with

spindly

very
polite
and
ready
to
be
amused
nna
ergyevna
who
still
talked
principally
with
azarov
asked
him
whether
hed
like
to
try
a
contest
with
them
in
the
oldfashioned
way
at
preference
azarov
assented
saying
that
he
ought
to
prepare
himself
beforehand
for
the
duties
awaiting
him
as
a
country
doctorou
must
be
careful

she
added

to

fond

we
can
listen
tooatya
went
unwillingly
to
the
piano
and
rkady
though
he
certainly
was
fond
of
music
unwillingly
followed
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
adame
dintsov
was
sending
him
away
and
already
like
every
young
man
at
his
age
he
felt
a
vague
and
oppressive
emotion
surging
up
in
his
heart
like
the
forebodings
of
love
atya
raised
the
top
of
the
piano
and
not
looking
at

said
in

pulled
out
ozarts
onataantasia
in

he
played
very
well
though
rather
over
correctly
and
precisely
he
sat
upright
and
immovable
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
notes
and
her
lips
tightly
compressed
only
at
the
end
of
the
sonata
her
face
glowed
her
hair
came
loose
and
a
little
lock
fell
on
to
her
dark
browrkady
was
particularly
struck
by
the
last
part
of
the
sonata
the
part
in
which
in
the
midst
of
the
bewitching
gaiety
of
the
careless
melody
the
pangs
of
such
mournful
almost
tragic
suffering
suddenly
break
in
ut
the
ideas
stirred
in
him
by
ozarts
music
had
no
reference
to
atya
ooking
at
her
he
simply
thought
ell
that
young
lady
doesnt
play
badly
and
shes
not
badlooking
eitherhen
she
had
finished
the
sonata
atya
without
taking
her
hands
from
the
keys
asked
s
that
enough
rkady
declared
that
he
could
not
venture
to
trouble
her
again
and
began
talking
to
her
about
ozart
he
asked
her
whether
she
had
chosen
that
sonata
herself
or
some
one
had
recommended
it
to
her
ut
atya
answered
him
in
monosyllables
she
withdrew
into
herself
went
back
into
her
shell
hen
this
happened
to
her
she
did
not
very
quickly
come
out
again
her
face
even
assumed
at
such
times
an
obstinate
almost
stupid
expression
he
was
not
exactly
shy
but
diffident
and
rather
overawed
by
her
sister
who
had
educated
her
and
who
had
no
suspicion
of
the
fact
rkady
was
reduced
at
last
to
calling
ifi
to
him
and
with
an
affable
smile
patting
him
on
the
head
to
give
himself

appearance

might
make

fine
out
of
her
but
the
othersa
stale
loafrkady
made
no
reply
to
azarov
and
each
of
them
got
into
bed
with
rather
singular
thoughts
in
his
headnna
ergyevna
too
thought
of
her
guests
that
evening
he
liked
azarov
for
the
absence
of
gallantry
in
him
and
even
for
his
sharply
defined
views
he
found
in
him
something
new
which
she
had
not
chanced
to
meet
before
and
she
was
curiousnna
ergyevna
was
a
rather
strange
creature
aving
no
prejudices
of
any
kind
having
no
strong
convictions
even
she
never
gave
way
or
went
out
of
her
way
for
anything
he
had
seen
many
things
very
clearly
she
had
been
interested
in
many
things
but
nothing
had
completely
satisfied
her
indeed
she
hardly
desired
complete
satisfaction
er
intellect
was
at
the
same
time
inquiring
and
indifferent
her
doubts
were
never
soothed
to
forgetfulness
and
they
never
grew
strong
enough
to
distract
her
ad
she
not
been
rich
and
independent
she
would
perhaps
have
thrown
herself
into
the
struggle
and
have
known
passion
ut
life
was
easy
for
her
though
she
was
bored
at
times
and
she
went
on
passing
day
after
day
with
deliberation
never
in
a
hurry
placid
and
only
rarely
disturbed
reams
sometimes
danced
in
rainbow
colours
before
her
eyes
even
but
she
breathed
more
freely
when
they
died
away
and
did
not
regret
them
er
imagination
indeed
overstepped
the
limits
of
what
is
reckoned
permissible
by
conventional
morality
but
even
then
her
blood
flowed
as
quietly
as
ever
in
her
fascinatingly
graceful
tranquil
body
ometimes
coming
out
of
her
fragrant
bath
all
warm
and
enervated
she
would
fall
to
musing
on
the
nothingness
of
life
the
sorrow
the
labour
the
malice
of
it
er
soul
would
be
filled
with
sudden
daring
and
would
flow
with
generous
ardour
but
a
draught
would
blow
from
a
halfclosed
window
and
nna
ergyevna
would
shrink
into
herself
and
feel
plaintive
and
almost
angry
and
there
was
only
one
thing
she
cared
for
at
that
instantto
get
away
from
that
horrid
draughtike
all
women
who
have
not
succeeded
in
loving
she
wanted
something
without
herself
knowing
what
trictly
speaking
she
wanted
nothing
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
wanted
everything
he
could
hardly
endure
the
late
dintsov
she
had
married
him
from
prudential
motives
though
probably
she
would
not
have
consented
to
become
his
wife
if
she
had
not
considered
him
a
good
sort
of
man
and
had
conceived
a
secret
repugnance
for
all
men
whom
she
could
only
figure
to
herself
as
slovenly
heavy
drowsy
and
feebly
importunate
creatures
nce
somewhere
abroad
she
had
met
a
handsome
young
wede
with
a
chivalrous
expression
with
honest
blue
eyes
under
an
open
brow
he
had
made
a
powerful
impression
on
her
but
it
had
not
prevented
her
from
going
back
to
ussia
strange
man
this
doctor
she
thought
as
she
lay
in
her
luxurious
bed
on
lace
pillows
under
a
light
silk
coverlet
nna
ergyevna
had
inherited
from
her
father
a
little
of
his
inclination
for
splendour
he
had
fondly
loved
her
sinful
but
goodnatured
father
and
he
had
idolised
her
used
to
joke
with
her
in
a
friendly
way
as
though
she
were
an
equal
and
to
confide
in
her
fully
to
ask
her
advice
er
mother
she
scarcely
rememberedhis
doctor
is
a
strange
man
she
repeated
to
herself
he
stretched
smiled
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
then
ran
her
eyes
over
two
pages
of
a
stupid
rench
novel
dropped
the
bookand
fell
asleep
all
pure
and
cold
in
her
pure
and
fragrant
linenhe
following
morning
nna
ergyevna
went
off
botanising
with
azarov
directly
after
lunch
and
returned
just
before
dinner
rkady
did
not
go
off
anywhere
and
spent
about
an
hour
with
atya
e
was
not
bored
with
her
she
offered
of
herself
to
repeat
the
sonata
of
the
day
before
but
when
adame
dintsov
came
back
at
last
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
he
felt
an
instantaneous
pang
at
his
heart
he
came
through
the
garden
with
a
rather
tired
step
her
cheeks
were
glowing
and
her
eyes
shining
more
brightly
than
usual
under
her
round
straw
hat
he
was
twirling
in
her
fingers
the
thin
stalk
of
a
wildflower
a
light
mantle
had
slipped
down
to
her
elbows
and
the
wide
gray
ribbons
of
her
hat
were
clinging
to
her
bosom
azarov
walked
behind
her
selfconfident
and
careless
as
usual
but
the
expression
of
his
face
cheerful
and
even
friendly
as
it
was
did
not
please
rkady
uttering
between
his
teeth
oodmorning
azarov
went
away
to
his
room
while
adame
dintsov
shook
rkadys
hand
abstractedly
and
also
walked
past
himoodmorning
thought
rkady
s
though
we
had
not
seen
each
other
already
today
ime
it
is
well
known
sometimes
flies
like
a
bird
sometimes
crawls
like
a
worm
but
man
is
wont
to
be
particularly
happy
when
he
does
not
even
notice
whether
it
passes
quickly
or
slowly
t
was
in
that
way
rkady
and
azarov
spent
a
fortnight
at
adame
dintsovs
he
good
order
she
had
established
in
her
house
and
in
her
life
partly
contributed
to
this
result
he
adhered
strictly
to
this
order
herself
and
forced
others
to
submit
to
it
verything
during
the
day
was
done
at
a
fixed
time
n
the
morning
precisely
at
eight
oclock
all
the
party
assembled
for
tea
from
morningtea
till
lunchtime
every
one
did
what
he
pleased
the
hostess
herself
was
engaged
with
her
bailiff
the
estate
was
on
the
rentsystem
her
steward
and
her
head
housekeeper
efore
dinner
the
party
met
again
for
conversation
or
reading
the
evening
was
devoted
to
walking
cards
and
music
at
halfpast
ten
nna
ergyevna
retired
to
her
own
room
gave
her
orders
for
the
following
day
and
went
to
bed
azarov
did
not
like
this
measured
somewhat
ostentatious
punctuality
in
daily
life
like
moving
along
rails
he
pronounced
it
to
be
the
footmen
in
livery
the
decorous
stewards
offended
his
democratic
sentiments
e
declared
that
if
one
went
so
far
one
might
as
well
dine
in
the
nglish
style
at
oncein
tailcoats
and
white
ties
e
once
spoke
plainly
upon
the
subject
to
nna
ergyevna
er
attitude
was
such
that
no
one
hesitated
to
speak
his
mind
freely
before
her
he
heard
him
out
and
then
her
comment
was
rom
your
point
of
view
you
are
rightand
perhaps
in
that
respect
am
too
much
of
a
lady
but
theres
no
living
in
the
country
without
order
one
would
be
devoured
by
ennui
and
she
continued
to
go
her
own
way
azarov
grumbled
but
the
very
reason
life
was
so
easy
for
him
and
rkady
at
adame
dintsovs
was
that
everything
in
the
house
moved
on
rails
or
all
that
a
change
had
taken
place
in
both
the
young
men
since
the
first
days
of
their
stay
at
ikolskoe
azarov
in
whom
nna
ergyevna
was
obviously
interested
though
she
seldom
agreed
with
him
began
to
show
signs
of
an
unrest
unprecedented
in
him
he
was
easily
put
out
of
temper
and
unwilling
to
talk
he
looked
irritated
and
could
not
sit
still
in
one
place
just
as
though
he
were
possessed
by
some
secret
longing
while
rkady
who
had
made
up
his
mind
conclusively
that
he
was
in
love
with
adame
dintsov
had
begun
to
yield
to
a
gentle
melancholy
his
melancholy
did
not
however
prevent
him
from
becoming
friendly
with
atya
it
even
impelled
him
to
get
into
friendly
affectionate
terms
with
her
he
does
not
appreciate
me
o
be
it
ut
here
is
a
good
creature
who
does
not
repulse
me
he
thought
and
his
heart
again
knew
the
sweetness
of
magnanimous
emotions
atya
vaguely
realised
that
he
was
seeking
a
sort
of
consolation
in
her
company
and
did
not
deny
him
or
herself
the
innocent
pleasure
of
a
halfshy
halfconfidential
friendship
hey
did
not
talk
to
each
other
in
nna
ergyevnas
presence
atya
always
shrank
into
herself
under
her
sisters
sharp
eyes
while
rkady
as
befits
a
man
in
love
could
pay
attention
to
nothing
else
when
near
the
object
of
his
passion
but
he
was
happy
with
atya
alone
e
was
conscious
that
he
did
not
possess
the
power
to
interest
adame
dintsov
he
was
shy
and
at
a
loss
when
he
was
left
alone
with
her
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
he
was
too
young
for
her
ith
atya
on
the
other
hand
rkady
felt
at
home
he
treated
her
condescendingly
encouraged
her
to
express
the
impressions
made
on
her
by
music
reading
novels
verses
and
other
such
trifles
without
noticing
or
realising
that
these
trifles
were
what
interested
him
too
atya
on
her
side
did
not
try
to
drive
away
melancholy
rkady
was
at
his
ease
with
atya
adame
dintsov
with
azarov
and
thus
it
usually
came
to
pass
that
the
two
couples
after
being
a
little
while
together
went
off
on
their
separate
ways
especially
during
the
walks
atya
adored
nature
and
rkady
loved
it
though
he
did
not
dare
to
acknowledge
it
adame
dintsov
was
like
azarov
rather
indifferent
to
the
beauties
of
nature
he
almost
continual
separation
of
the
two
friends
was
not
without
its
consequences
the
relations
between
them
began
to
change
azarov
gave
up
talking
to
rkady
about
adame
dintsov
gave
up
even
abusing
her
aristocratic
ways
atya
it
is
true
he
praised
as
before
and
only
advised
him
to
restrain
her
sentimental
tendencies
but
his
praises
were
hurried
his
advice
dry
and
in
general
he
talked
less
to
rkady
than
before
he
seemed
to
avoid
him
seemed
ill
at
ease
with
himrkady
observed
it
all
but
he
kept
his
observations
to
himselfhe
real
cause
of
all
this
newness
was
the
feeling
inspired
in
azarov
by
adame
dintsov
a
feeling
which
tortured
and
maddened
him
and
which
he
would
at
once
have
denied
with
scornful
laughter
and
cynical
abuse
if
any
one
had
ever
so
remotely
hinted
at
the
possibility
of
what
was
taking
place
in
him
azarov
had
a
great
love
for
women
and
for
feminine
beauty
but
love
in
the
ideal
or
as
he
expressed
it
romantic
sense
he
called
lunacy
unpardonable
imbecility
he
regarded
chivalrous
sentiments
as
something
of
the
nature
of
deformity
or
disease
and
had
more
than
once
expressed
his
wonder
that
oggenburg
and
all
the
minnesingers
and
troubadours
had
not
been
put
into
a
lunatic
asylum
f
a
woman
takes
your
fancy
he
used
to
say
try
and
gain
your
end
but
if
you
cantwell
turn
your
back
on
herthere
are
lots
of
good
fish
in
the
sea
adame
dintsov
had
taken
his
fancy
the
rumours
about
her
the
freedom
and
independence
of
her
ideas
her
unmistakable
liking
for
him
all
seemed
to
be
in
his
favour
but
he
soon
saw
that
with
her
he
would
not
gain
his
ends
and
to
turn
his
back
on
her
he
found
to
his
own
bewilderment
beyond
his
power
is
blood
was
on
fire
directly
if
he
merely
thought
of
her
he
could
easily
have
mastered
his
blood
but
something
else
was
taking
root
in
him
something
he
had
never
admitted
at
which
he
had
always
jeered
at
which
all
his
pride
revolted
n
his
conversations
with
nna
ergyevna
he
expressed
more
strongly
than
ever
his
calm
contempt
for
everything
idealistic
but
when
he
was
alone
with
indignation
he
recognised
idealism
in
himself
hen
he
would
set
off
to
the
forest
and
walk
with
long
strides
about
it
smashing
the
twigs
that
came
in
his
way
and
cursing
under
his
breath
both
her
and
himself
or
he
would
get
into
the
hayloft
in
the
barn
and
obstinately
closing
his
eyes
try
to
force
himself
to
sleep
in
which
of
course
he
did
not
always
succeed
uddenly
his
fancy
would
bring
before
him
those
chaste
hands
twining
one
day
about
his
neck
those
proud
lips
responding
to
his
kisses
those
intellectual
eyes
dwelling
with
tendernessyes
with
tendernesson
his
and
his
head
went
round
and
he
forgot
himself
for
an
instant
till
indignation
boiled
up
in
him
again
e
caught
himself
in
all
sorts
of
shameful
thoughts
as
though
he
were
driven
on
by
a
devil
mocking
him
ometimes
he
fancied
that
there
was
a
change
taking
place
in
adame
dintsov
too
that
there
were
signs
in
the
expression
of
her
face
of
something
special
that
perhaps
but
at
that
point
he
would
stamp
or
grind
his
teeth
and
clench
his
fistseanwhile
azarov
was
not
altogether
mistaken
e
had
struck
adame
dintsovs
imagination
he
interested
her
she
thought
a
great
deal
about
him
n
his
absence
she
was
not
dull
she
was
not
impatient
for
his
coming
but
she
always
grew
more
lively
on
his
appearance
she
liked
to
be
left
alone
with
him
and
she
liked
talking
to
him
even
when
he
irritated
her
or
offended
her
taste
her
refined
habits
he
was
as
it
were
eager
at
once
to
sound
him
and
to
analyse
herselfne
day
walking
in
the
garden
with
her
he
suddenly
announced
in
a
surly
voice
that
he
intended
going
to
his
fathers
place
very
soon
he
turned
white
as
though
something
had
given
her
a
pang
and
such
a
pang
that
she
wondered
and
pondered
long
after
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
azarov
had
spoken
of
his
departure
with
no
idea
of
putting
her
to
the
test
of
seeing
what
would
come
of
it
he
never
fabricated
n
the
morning
of
that
day
he
had
an
interview
with
his
fathers
bailiff
who
had
taken
care
of
him
when
he
was
a

his

experience
and
astuteness
with
faded
yellow
hair
a
weatherbeaten
red
face
and
tiny
teardrops
in
his
shrunken
eyes
unexpectedly
appeared
before
azarov
in
his
shortish
overcoat
of
stout
greyishblue
cloth
girt
with
a
strip
of
leather
and
in
tarred
bootsullo

with

he
went
out

pulled

down
on
his
head
with
both
hands
clambered
into
a
wretchedlooking
racing
droshky
and
went
off
at
a
trot

not

the
evening
of
the

day
adame

she
made

again
ou

to

at

from

dimly
in
the
middle
of
the
dark
luxurious
isolated
room
from
time
to
time
the
blind
was
shaken
and
there
flowed
in
the
freshness
of
the
insidious
night
there
was
heard
its
mysterious
whisperings
adame
dintsov
did
not
move
in
a
single
limb
but
she
was
gradually
possessed
by
concealed
emotiont

itself
to

suddenly
conscious
that
he
was
alone
with
a
young
and
lovely
womanhere

going
she
said
slowlye
answered
nothing
and
sank
into
a
chairnd
so
you
consider
me
a
placid
pampered
spoiled
creature
she
went
on
in

voice

down

for

from

of

went
back
two
hours

to

with

with

into

he

following

when

came
down
to

azarov
sat
a
long
while
bending
over
his
cup
then
suddenly
he
glanced
up
at
her
he
turned
to
him
as
though
he
had
struck
her
a
blow
and
he
fancied
that
her
face
was
a
little
paler
since
the
night
before
he
quickly
went
off
to
her
own
room
and
did
not
appear
till

from
early

there
was
no
possibility
of

assembled
in

took
up
the
new
number
of

and
began
reading
it
aloud

princess
as
was
her
habit
tried
to
express
her
amazement
in
her
face
as
though
he
were
doing
something
improper
then
glared
angrily
at

he

looked
round
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
ook
at

how
shocked

and
again
glared
at

he
raised
his

and
exchanging
glances
with

was
sitting
he
went
on

dintsov
went
with
rapid
steps
to
her
study
azarov
followed
her
quickly
not
raising
his
eyes
and
only
with
his
ears
catching
the
delicate
swish
and
rustle
of
her
silk
gown
gliding
before
him
adame
dintsov
sank
into
the
same
easychair
in
which
she
had
sat
the
previous

up

why

that
even
when
we
are
enjoying
music
for
instance
or
a
fine
evening
or
a
conversation
with
sympathetic
people
it
all
seems
an
intimation
of
some
measureless
happiness
existing
apart
somewhere
rather
than
actual
happinesssuch

as
we
ourselves
are
in

is
it
r
perhaps
you
have
no
feeling
like

know
the
saying

azarov

like
that
to
put

off
because
you
have
no

do
you

assilyitch
that
could
understand
you

been
poor

and
ambitious
like
you
have
been
perhaps
through
the
same
trials
as
youhat
is
all
very
well
nna
ergyevna
but
you
must
pardon
me
for
am
not
in
the
habit
of
talking
freely
about
myself
at
any
time
as
a
rule
and
between
you
and
me
there
is
such
a
gulf
hat
sort
of
gulf
ou
mean
to
tell
me
again
that
am
an
aristocrat
o
more
of
that
evgeny
assilyitch
thought
had
proved
to
you
nd
even
apart
from
that
broke
in
azarov
what
could
induce
one
to
talk
and
think
about
the
future
which
for
the
most
part
does
not
depend
on
us

about
it

perhaps
you
consider
me
as
a

unworthy

you

all

despise
you

ergyevna
and
you
know
thato
dont
know
anything
but
let
us
suppose
so
understand
your
disinclination
to
talk
of
your
future
career
but
as
to
what
is
taking
place
within
you
now
aking
place
repeated
azarov
as
though
were
some
sort
of
government
or
society
n
any
case
it
is
utterly
uninteresting
and
besides
can
a
man
always
speak
of
everything
that
takes
place
in
himhy
dont
see
why
you
cant
speak
freely
of
everything

heartan

at

questioningly
s
you

went
on

still
something
tells

sure

got
up
and
went
to
the
window
nd
would

to

the
reason
of
this
reticence

repeated
adame
dintsov
with
a
sort
of
dread
she
did
not
at
the
time
understandnd
you
will
not
be
angryoo
azarov
was
standing
with
his
back
to
her
et
me
tell
you
then
that
love
you
like
a
fool
like
a
madman
here
youve
forced
it
out
of
meadame
dintsov
held
both
hands
out
before
her
but
azarov
was
leaning
with
his
forehead
pressed
against
the
window
pane
e
breathed
hard
his
whole
body
was
visibly
trembling
ut
it
was
not
the
tremor
of
youthful
timidity
not
the
sweet
alarm
of
the
first
declaration
that
possessed
him
it
was
passion
struggling
in
him
strong
and
painfulpassion
not
unlike
hatred
and
perhaps
akin
to
it
adame
dintsov
felt
both
afraid
and
sorry
for
himevgeny
assilyitch
she
said
and
there
was
the
ring
of
unconscious
tenderness
in
her
voicee
turned
quickly
flung
a
searching
look
on
her
and
snatching
both
her
hands
he
drew
her
suddenly
to
his
breasthe
did
not
at
once
free
herself
from
his
embrace
but
an
instant
later
she
was
standing
far
away
in
a
corner
and
looking
from
there
at
azarov
e
rushed
at
her
ou
have
misunderstood
me
she
whispered
hurriedly
in
alarm
t
seemed
if
he
had
made
another
step
she
would
have
screamed
azarov
bit
his
lips
and
went
outalfanhour
after
a
maid
gave
nna
ergyevna
a
note
from
azarov
it
consisted
simply
of
one
line
m
to
go
today
or
can
stop
till
tomorrowhy
should
you
go
did
not
understand
youyou
did
not
understand
me
nna
ergyevna
answered
him
but
to
herself
she
thought
did
not
understand
myself
eitherhe
did
not
show
herself
till
dinnertime
and
kept
walking
to
and
fro
in
her
room
stopping
sometimes
at
the
window
sometimes
at
the
lookingglass
and
slowly
rubbing
her
handkerchief
over
her
neck
on
which
she
still
seemed
to
feel
a
burning
spot
he
asked
herself
what
had
induced
her
to
force
azarovs
words
his
confidence
and
whether
she
had
suspected
nothing
am
to
blame
she
decided
aloud
but
could
not
have
foreseen
this
he
fell
to
musing
and
blushed
crimson
remembering
azarovs
almost
animal
face
when
he
had
rushed
at
herh
she
uttered
suddenly
aloud
and
she
stopped
short
and
shook
back
her
curls
he
caught
sight
of
herself
in
the
glass
her
head
thrown
back
with
a
mysterious
smile
on
the
halfclosed
halfopened
eyes
and
lips
told
her
it
seemed
in
a
flash
something
at
which
she
herself
was
confusedo
she
made
up
her
mind
at
last
od
knows
what
it
would
lead
to
he
couldnt
be
played
with
peace
is
anyway
the
best
thing
in
the
worlder
peace
of
mind
was
not
shaken
but
she
felt
gloomy
and
even
shed
a
few
tears
once
though
she
could
not
have
said
whycertainly
not
for
the
insult
done
her
he
did
not
feel
insulted
she
was
more
inclined
to
feel
guilty
nder
the
influence
of
various
vague
emotions
the
sense
of
life
passing
by
the
desire
of
novelty
she
had
forced
herself
to
go
up
to
a
certain
point
forced
herself
to
look
behind
herself
and
had
seen
behind
her
not
even
an
abyss
but
what
was

went
into

dinner

latonovitch
made
his
appearance
and
told
various
anecdotes
he

just
come
back
from

informed

that
the

rkady
talked
in
an
undertone
to
atya
and
diplomatically
attended
to

azarov
maintained
a
grim
and
obstinate
silence
adame
dintsov
looked
at
him
twice
not
stealthily
but
straight
in
the
face
which
was
bilious
and
forbidding
with
downcast
eyes
and
contemptuous
determination
stamped
on
every
feature
and
thought
o
no
no
fter
dinner
she
went
with
the
whole
company
into
the
garden
and
seeing
that
azarov
wanted
to
speak
to
her
she
took
a
few
steps
to
one
side
and
stopped
e
went
up
to
her
but
even
then
did
not
raise
his
eyes
and
said
hoarsely

apologise

an

dark
browsnna
ergyevna
did

m
afraid
of
this
man
flashed
through
her

then
said
azarov
as
though
he
guessed
her
thought
and
he
went
back
into
the
housenna
ergyevna
walked
slowly
after
him
and
calling
atya
to
her
she
took
her
arm
he
did
not
leave
her
side
till
quite
evening
he
did
not
play
cards
and
was
constantly
laughing
which
did
not
at
all
accord
with
her
pale
and
perplexed
face
rkady
was
bewildered
and
looked
on
at
her
as
all
young
people
look
onthats
to
say
he
was
constantly
asking
himself
hat
is
the
meaning
of
that
azarov
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
he
came
back
to
tea
however
nna
ergyevna
longed
to
say
some
friendly
word
to
him
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
address
himn
unexpected
incident
relieved
her
from
her
embarrassment
a
steward
announced
the
arrival
of
itnikovt
is
difficult
to
do
justice
in
words
to
the
strange
figure
cut
by
the
young
apostle
of
progress
as
he
fluttered
into
the
room
hough
with
his
characteristic
impudence
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
into
the
country
to
visit
a
woman
whom
he
hardly
knew
who
had
never
invited
him
but
with
whom
according
to
information
he
had
gathered
such
talented
and
intimate
friends
were
staying
he
was
nevertheless
trembling
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
and
instead
of
bringing
out
the
apologies
and
compliments
he
had
learned
by
heart
beforehand
he
muttered
some
absurdity
about
vdoksya
ukshin
having
sent
him
to
inquire
after
nna
ergyevnas
health
and
rkady
ikolaevitchs
too
having
always
spoken
to
him
in
the
highest
terms
t
this
point
he
faltered
and
lost
his
presence
of
mind
so
completely
that
he
sat
down
on
his
own
hat
owever
since
no
one
turned
him
out
and
nna
ergyevna
even
presented
him
to
her
aunt
and
her
sister
he
soon
recovered
himself
and
began
to
chatter
volubly
he
introduction
of
the
commonplace
is
often
an
advantage
in
life
it
relieves
overstrained
tension
and
sobers
too
selfconfident
or
selfsacrificing
emotions
by
recalling
its
close
kinship
with
them
ith
itnikovs
appearance
everything
became
somehow
duller
and
simpler
they
all
even
ate
a
more
solid
supper
and
retired
to
bed
halfanhour
earlier
than
usual
might
now
repeat
to
you
said
rkady
as
he
lay
down
in
bed
to
azarov
who
was
also
undressing
what
you
once
said
to
me
hy
are
you
so
melancholy
ne
would
think
you
had
fulfilled
some
sacred
duty
or
some
time
past
a
sort
of
pretence
of
freeandeasy
banter
had
sprung
up
between
the
two
young
men
which
is
always
an
unmistakable
sign
of
secret
displeasure
or
unexpressed
suspicionsm
going

my

said
azarovrkady
raised
himself
and
leaned
on
his
elbow
e
felt
both
surprised
and
for
some
reason
or
other
pleased

that
why

down
and

with
his

rkady
e

go
together
as
far
as

delighted
to

left

my

with

azarov
said
without
turning
roundhy
doesnt
he
ask
me
why
am
going
and
just
as
suddenly
as
he
thought
rkady
n
reality
why
am
going
and
why
is
he
going
he
pursued
his
reflections
e
could
find
no
satisfactory
answer
to
his
own
question
though
his
heart
was
filled
with
some
bitter
feeling
e
felt
it
would
be
hard
to
part
from
this
life
to
which
he
had
grown
so
accustomed
but
for
him
to
remain
alone
would
be
rather
odd
omething
has
passed
between
them
he
reasoned
to
himself
what
good
would
it
be
for
me
to
hang
on
after
hes
gone
hes
utterly
sick
of
me
m
losing
the
last
that
remained
to
me
e
began
to
imagine
nna
ergyevna
to
himself
then
other
features
gradually
eclipsed
the
lovely
image
of
the
young
widowm
sorry
to
lose
atya
too
rkady
whispered
to
his
pillow
on
which
a
tear
had
already
fallen
ll
at
once
he
shook
back
his
hair
and
said
aloudhat
the
devil
made
that
fool
of
a
itnikov
turn
up
hereazarov
at
first
stirred
a
little
in
his
bed
then
he
uttered
the
following
rejoinder
oure

a
fool
my

you
understand

not

rkady
thought
to
himself
and
then
in
a
flash
all
the
fathomless
depths
of
azarovs
conceit
dawned
upon
him
re
you
and
gods
then
at
least
youre
a
god

not
a
dolt

repeated
azarov
youre

dintsov
expressed
no
special
surprise
when
rkady
told
her
the
next
day
that
he
was
going
with
azarov
she
seemed
tired
and
absorbed
atya
looked
at
him
silently
and
seriously
the
princess
went
so
far
as
to
cross
herself
under
her
shawl
so
that
he
could
not
help
noticing
it
itnikov
on
the
other

completely
disconcerted

he
had
astonished
the
man
told
off
to
wait
on
him
by
the
amount
of
linen
he
had
brought
with
him
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
his
comrades
were
deserting
him
e
took
a
few
tiny
steps
doubled
back
like
a
hunted
hare
at
the
edge
of
a
copse
and
abruptly
almost
with
dismay
almost
with
a
wail
announced
that
he
proposed
going
too

dintsov
did
not
attempt
to
detain

coolly
pulled

warmly

for

appreciated
both
the

the
silence

have
thought
you
had
nothing
to
complain
ofnd
since
you
dont
quite
understand
me
ll
tell
you
thisto
my
mind
its
better
to

than
to

a
woman

the
mastery
of
even

all
azarov
was
on
the
point
of
uttering
his
favourite
word
romanticism
but
he
checked
himself
and
said
rubbish
ou
dont
believe
me
now
but
tell
you
you
and
have
been
in
feminine
society
and
very
nice
we
found
it
but
to
throw
up
society
like
that
is
for
all
the
world
like
a
dip
in
cold
water
on
a
hot
day
man
hasnt
time
to
attend
to
such
trifles
a
man
ought
not

an

gave
a
forced
laugh
while
azarov
turned
away
and
did
not
open
his
mouth
again
the
whole
journeyhe
twenty
miles
seemed
to
rkady
quite
forty
ut
at
last
on
the
slope
of
some
rising
ground
appeared
the
small
hamlet
where
azarovs
parents
lived
eside
it
in
a
young
birch
copse
could
be
seen
a
small
house
with
a
thatched
roofwo
peasants
stood
with
their
hats
on
at
the
first
hut
abusing
each
other
oure

worse
than
a
little

your

retorted
the
otherrom
their
unconstrained
behaviour
azarov
remarked
to
rkady
and
the
playfulness
of
their
retorts
you
can
guess
that
my
fathers
peasants
are
not
too
much
oppressed
hy
there
he
is
himself
coming
out
on
the
steps
of
his
house

its

his
figure
y
ay
how
grey
hes
grown
though
poor
chap
azarov
leaned
out
of
the
coach
while
rkady
thrust
his
head
out
behind
his
companions
back
and
caught
sight
on
the
steps
of
the
little
manorhouse
of
a
tall
thinnish
man
with
dishevelled
hair
and
a
thin
hawk
nose
dressed
in
an
old
military
coat
not
buttoned
up
e
was
standing
his
legs
wide
apart
smoking
a
long
pipe
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
to
keep
the
sun
out
of

down

and
in
the
doorway
was
seen
a
plump
short
little
old
woman
in
a
white
cap
and
a
short
striped
jacket
he
moaned
staggered
and
would
certainly
have
fallen
had
not
azarov
supported
her
er
plump
little
hands
were
instantly
twined
round
his
neck
her
head
was
pressed
to
his
breast
and
there
was
a
complete
hush
he
only
sound
heard
was
her
broken
sobsld
azarov
breathed
hard
and
screwed
his
eyes
up
more
than
everhere

enough

he
said
exchanging
a
glance
with
rkady
who
remained
motionless
in
the
coach
while
the
peasant
on

away
from

azarov
interrupted
again
oud
much
better
sit
here
on
the
sofa
and
let
us
have
a
look
at
youassily
vanovitch
laughed
and
sat
down
e
was
very
like
his
son
in
face
only
his
brow
was
lower
and
narrower
and
his
mouth
rather
wider
and
he
was
for
ever
restless
shrugging
up
his
shoulder
as
though
his
coat
cut
him
under
the
armpits
blinking
clearing
his
throat
and
gesticulating
with
his
fingers
while
his

was

a

of
nonchalant

repeated
assily
vanovitch
ou

not
imagine

want
to
appeal
so
to
speak
to

by
making
out
we
live
in
such
a
wilderness
uite
the
contrary
maintain
that
for
a

nothing
is
a

t

try
as
far
as
possible
not
to
get
rusty
so
to
speak
not
to
fall
behind
the
ageassily
vanovitch
drew
out
of
his
pocket
a
new
yellow
silk
handkerchief
which
he
had
had
time
to
snatch
up
on
the
way
to
rkadys
room
and
flourishing
it
in
the
air
he
proceeded
am
not

to
the
fact
that
for

at
the
cost
of

not
inconsiderable
for
me

put
my
peasants
on
the

and
given
up
my

to
them
on
half
profits
regarded
that
as
my

itself

a

me

an

assily
vanovitch
made
haste
to
answer
but
we
have
for
instance
some
idea
even
of
phrenology
he
added
addressing
himself
principally
however
to
rkady
and
pointing
to
a
small
plaster

on
the
cupboard
divided
into
numbered
squares

azarov

of
desperation
when
the

gone

the
servant
didnt
let
the
doctor
speak

no

told

went
on
in
this
way
for
about
an
hour
rkady
had
time
to
go
to
his
room
which
turned
out
to
be
the
anteroom
attached
to
the
bathroom
but
was
very
snug
and
clean
t

anyusha
came
in
and
announced
that

vanovitch
was
the
first
to

gentlemen
ou
must
be
magnanimous
and
pardon
me
if

bored
you

my
good
wife
will
give
you
more
satisfactionhe
dinner
though
prepared
in
haste
turned
out
to
be
very
good
even
abundant
only
the
wine
was
not
quite
up
to
the
mark
it
was
almost
black
sherry
bought
by
imofeitch
in
the
town
at
a
wellknown
merchants
and
had
a
faint
coppery
resinous
taste
and
the
flies
were
a
great
nuisance
n
ordinary
days
a
serfboy
used
to
keep
driving
them
away
with
a
large
green
branch
but
on
this
occasion
assily
vanovitch
had
sent
him
away
through
dread
of
the
criticism
of
the
younger
generation
rina
lasyevna
had
had
time
to
dress
she
had
put
on
a
high
cap
with
silk
ribbons
and
a
pale
blue
flowered
shawl
he
broke
down
again
directly
she
caught
sight
of
her
nyusha
but
her
husband
had
no
need
to
admonish
her
she
made
haste
to
wipe
away
her
tears
herself
for
fear
of
spotting
her
shawl
nly
the
young
men
ate
anything
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
had
dined
long
ago
edka
waited
at
table
obviously
encumbered
by
having
boots
on
for
the
first
time
he
was
assisted
by
a
woman
of
a
masculine
cast
of
face
and
one
eye
by
name
nfisushka
who
performed
the
duties
of
housekeeper
poultrywoman
and
laundress
assily
vanovitch
walked
up
and
down
during
the
whole
of
dinner
and
with
a
perfectly
happy
positively
beatific
countenance
talked
about
the
serious
anxiety
he
felt
at
apoleons
policy
and
the
intricacy
of
the
talian
question
rina
lasyevna
took
no
notice
of
rkady
he
did
not
press
him
to
eat
leaning
her
round
face
to
which
the
full
cherrycoloured
lips
and
the
little
moles
on
the
cheeks
and
over
the
eyebrows
gave
a
very
simple
goodnatured
expression
on
her
little
closed
fist
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
her
son
and
kept
constantly
sighing
she
was
dying
to
know
for
how
long
he
had
come
but
she
was
afraid
to
ask
himhat
if
he
says
for
two
days
she
thought
and
her
heart
sank
fter
the
roast
assily
vanovitch
disappeared
for
an
instant
and
returned
with
an
opened
halfbottle
of
champagne
ere
he
cried
though
we
do
live
in
the
wilds
we
have
something
to
make
merry
with
on
festive
occasions
e
filled
three
champagne
glasses
and
a
little
wineglass
proposed
the
health
of
our
inestimable
guests
and
at
once
tossed
off
his
glass
in
military
fashion
while
he
made
rina
lasyevna
drink
her
wineglass
to
the
last
drop
hen
the
time
came
in
due
course
for
preserves
rkady
who
could
not
bear
anything
sweet
thought
it
his
duty
however
to
taste
four
different
kinds
which
had
been
freshly
made
all
the
more
as
azarov
flatly
refused
them
and
began
at
once
smoking
a
cigarette
hen
tea
came
on
the
scene
with
cream
butter
and
cracknels
then
assily
vanovitch
took
them
all
into
the
garden
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
evening
s
they
passed
a
garden
seat
he
whispered
to
rkadyt
this
spot

to
meditate
as
watch
the
sunset

on

stealthily
behind
his
back
she

wished
him

repose
as
enjoyed
at
your
happy
years
nd
rkady
did
as
a
fact
sleep
excellently
in
his
bathhouse
there
was
a
smell
of
mint
in
it
and
two
crickets
behind
the
stove
rivalled
each
other
in
their
drowsy
chirping
assily
vanovitch
went
from
rkadys
room
to
his
study
and
perching
on
the
sofa
at
his
sons
feet
he
was
looking
forward
to
having
a
chat
with
him
but
azarov
at
once
sent
him
away
saying
he
was
sleepy
and
did
not
fall
asleep
till
morning
ith
wide
open
eyes
he
stared
vindictively
into
the
darkness
the
memories
of
childhood
had
no
power
over
him
and
besides
he
had
not
yet
had
time
to
get
rid
of
the
impression
of
his
recent
bitter
emotions
rina
lasyevna
first
prayed
to
her
hearts
content
then
she
had
a
long
long
conversation
with
nfisushka
who
stood
stockstill
before
her
mistress
and
fixing
her
solitary
eye
upon
her
communicated
in
a
mysterious
whisper
all
her
observations
and
conjectures
in
regard
to
evgeny
assilyevitch
he
old
ladys
head
was
giddy
with
happiness
and
wine
and
tobacco
smoke
her
husband
tried
to
talk
to
her
but
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
gave
it
up
in
despairrina
lasyevna
was
a
genuine
ussian
gentlewoman
of
the
olden
times
she
ought
to
have
lived
two
centuries
before
in
the
old
oscow
days
he
was
very
devout
and
emotional
she
believed
in
fortunetelling
charms
dreams
and
omens
of
every
possible
kind
she
believed
in
the
prophecies
of
crazy
people
in
housespirits
in
woodspirits
in
unlucky
meetings
in
the
evil
eye
in
popular
remedies
she
ate
specially
prepared
salt
on
oly
hursday
and
believed
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
she
believed
that
if
on
aster
unday
the
lights
did
not
go
out
at
vespers
then
there
would
be
a
good
crop
of
buckwheat
and
that
a
mushroom
will
not
grow
after
it
has
been
looked
on
by
the
eye
of
man
she
believed
that
the
devil
likes
to
be
where
there
is
water
and
that
every
ew
has
a
bloodstained
patch
on
his
breast
she
was
afraid
of
mice
of
snakes
of
frogs
of
sparrows
of
leeches
of
thunder
of
cold
water
of
draughts
of
horses
of
goats
of
redhaired
people
and
black
cats
and
she
regarded
crickets
and
dogs
as
unclean
beasts
she
never
ate
veal
doves
crayfishes
cheese
asparagus
artichokes
hares
nor
watermelons
because
a
cut
watermelon
suggested
the
head
of
ohn
the
aptist
and
of
oysters
she
could
not
speak
without
a
shudder
she
was
fond
of
eatingand
fasted
rigidly
she
slept
ten
hours
out
of
the
twentyfourand
never
went
to
bed
at
all
if
assily
vanovitch
had
so
much
as
a
headache
she
had
never
read
a
single
book
except
lexis
or
the
ottage
in
the
orest
she
wrote
one
or
at
the
most
two
letters
in
a
year
but
was
great
in
housewifery
preserving
and
jammaking
though
with
her
own
hands
she
never
touched
a
thing
and
was
generally
disinclined
to
move
from
her
place
rina
lasyevna
was
very
kindhearted
and
in
her
way
not
at
all
stupid
he
knew
that
the
world
is
divided
into
masters
whose
duty
it
is
to
command
and
simple
folk
whose
duty
it
is
to
serve
themand
so
she
felt
no
repugnance
to
servility
and
prostrations
to
the
ground
but
she
treated
those
in
subjection
to
her
kindly
and
gently
never
let
a
single
beggar
go
away
emptyhanded
and
never
spoke
ill
of
any
one
though
she
was
fond
of
gossip
n
her
youth
she
had
been
pretty
had
played
the
clavichord
and
spoken
rench
a
little
but
in
the
course
of
many
years
wanderings
with
her
husband
whom
she
had
married
against
her
will
she
had
grown
stout
and
forgotten
music
and
rench
er
son
she
loved
and
feared
unutterably
she
had
given
up
the
management
of
the
property
to
assily
vanovitchand
now
did
not
interfere
in
anything
she
used
to
groan
wave
her
handkerchief
and
raise
her
eyebrows
higher
and
higher
with
horror
directly
her
old
husband
began
to
discuss
the
impending
government
reforms
and
his
own
plans
he
was
apprehensive
and
constantly
expecting
some
great
misfortune
and
began
to
weep
directly
she
remembered
anything
sorrowful

not

without

am
sincerely
delighted
at
the
friendship

between
you
and
my
son
have
just
seen
him
he
got
up
as
he
usually
doesno
doubt
you
are
aware
of
itvery
early
and
went
a
ramble
about
the
neighbourhood
ermit

to
inquirehave
you

my

longince
last
winterndeed
nd
permit
me
to
question
you
furtherbut
hadnt
we
better
sit
down
ermit
me
as
a
father
to
ask
without
reserve
hat
is
your
opinion
of
my
evgenyour
son
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
have
ever
met
rkady
answered
emphaticallyassily
vanovitchs
eyes
suddenly
grew
round
and
his
cheeks
were
suffused
with
a
faint
flush
he
spade
fell
out
of
his
handnd
so
you
expect
he
began
m
convinced
rkady
put
in
that
your
son
has
a
great
future
before
him
that
he
will
do
honour
to
your
name
ve
been
certain
of
that
ever
since
first
met
himow
how
was
that
assily
vanovitch
articulated
with
an
effort
is
wide
mouth
was
relaxed
in
a
triumphant
smile
which
would
not
leave
itould
you
like
me
to
tell
you
how
we
metes
and
altogetherrkady
began
to
tell
his
tale
and
to
talk
of
azarov
with
even
greater
warmth
even
greater
enthusiasm
than
he
had
done
on
the
evening
when
he
danced
a
mazurka
with
adame
dintsovassily
vanovitch
listened
and
listened
blinked
and
rolled
his
handkerchief
up
into
a
ball
in
both
his
hands
cleared
his
throat
ruffled
up
his
hair
and
at
last
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
bent
down
to
rkady
and
kissed
him
on
his
shoulder
ou
have
made
me
perfectly
happy
he
said
never
ceasing
to
smile
ought
to
tell
you
idolise
my
son
my
old
wife
wont
speak
ofwe
all
know
what
mothers
arebut
dare
not
show
my
feelings
before
him
because
he
doesnt
like
it
e
is
averse
to
every
kind
of
demonstration
of
feeling
many
people
even
find
fault
with
him
for
such
firmness
of
character
and
regard
it
as
a
proof
of
pride
or
lack
of
feeling
but
men
like
him
ought
not
to
be
judged
by
the
common
standard
ought
they
nd
here
for
example
many
another
fellow
in
his
place
would
have
been
a
constant
drag
on
his
parents
but
he
would
you
believe
it
has
never
from
the
day
he
was
born
taken
a
farthing
more
than
he
could
help
thats
ods
truthe
is
a
disinterested
honest
man
observed
rkadyxactly
so
he
is
disinterested
nd
dont
only
idolise
him
rkady
ikolaitch
am
proud
of
him
and
the
height
of
my
ambition
is
that
some
day
there
will
be
the
following
lines
in
his
biography
he
son
of
a
simple
armydoctor
who
was
however
capable
of
divining
his
greatness
betimes
and
spared
nothing
for
his
education
he

do
you

inquired
assily
vanovitch
after
a
short
silence
will
it
be
in
the
career
of
medicine
that
he
will
attain
the
celebrity

for

even
in

the

crowing
irritably
at

in

producing
in
every
one
who
heard
them
a
strange
sense
of

somewhere

up
in

the

of

at

rkady
in

the

answered
azarov
ut
neither

feeling
almost
of
hostility

come
over
both
the
young
men

minutes
later
they
opened

declare
its

n
idea
came
into

this
is

cried
rkadyha
family
feeling

there
azarov
commented
coolly
ve
noticed
how
obstinately
it
sticks
to
people
mans
ready
to
give
up
everything
and
break
with
every
prejudice
but
to
admit
that
his
brother
for
instance
who
steals
handkerchiefs
is
a
thiefthats
too
much
for
him
nd
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
my
brother
mineand
no
genius
thats
an
idea
no
one
can
swallowt
was
a
simple
sense
of
justice
spoke
in
me
and
not
in
the
least
family
feeling
retorted
rkady
passionately
ut
since
thats
a
sense
you
dont
understand
since
you
havent
that
sensation
you
cant
judge
of
itn
other
words
rkady
irsanov
is
too
exalted
for
my
comprehension
bow
down
before
him
and

no
moreont

we
shall
really
quarrel
at
lasth
rkady
do
me
a
kindness
entreat
you
let
us
quarrel
for
once
in

then
perhaps
we
should
end
by
ighting
put
in
azarov
ell
ere
on
the
hay
in
these
idyllic
surroundings
far
from
the
world
and
the
eyes
of
men
it
wouldnt
matter
ut
youd
be
no
match
for
me
ll
have
you
by
the
throat
in
a
minuteazarov
spread
out
his
long
cruel
fingers
rkady
turned
round
and
prepared
as
though
in
jest
to
resist
ut
his
friends
face
struck
him
as
so
vindictivethere
was
such
menace
in
grim
earnest
in
the
smile
that
distorted
his
lips
and
in
his
glittering
eyes
that
he
felt
instinctively
afraidh
so
this
is
where
you
have
got
to
the
voice
of
assily
vanovitch
was
heard
saying
at
that
instant
and
the
old
armydoctor
appeared
before
the
young
men
garbed
in
a
homemade
linen
peajacket
with
a
straw
hat
also
homemade
on
his
head
ve
been
looking
everywhere
for

youve
picked
out
a
capital
place
and
youre
excellently
employed

you
know
theres
a
special
significance
in
that
never
gaze
up
to

except
when

to
sneeze
growled
azarov
and
turning
to
rkady
he
added
in
an
undertone
ity
he
interrupted
usome
hush
whispered
rkady
and
he
secretly
squeezed
his
friends
hand
ut
no
friendship

long
stand
such
shocks

at
you
my
youthful
friends
assily
vanovitch
was
saying
meantime
shaking
his
head
and
leaning
his
folded
arms
on
a
rather
cunningly
bent
stick
of
his
own
carving
with
a
urks

rkadyassily
vanovitch
lowered
himself
sighing
into
the
hay
our
present
quarters
remind
me
my
dear
sirs
he
began
of
my
military
bivouacking
existence
the
ambulance
halts
somewhere
like

under
a
haystack
and
even
for
that
we
were
thankful
e
sighed

many
many
experiences
in
my
life
or

if
you
will
allow
me
will
tell
you
a

y
the

not

told
you
that

no

muttered
assily
vanovitch
he
had
only
the
evening
before
had
the
red
ribbon
unpicked
off
his
coat
and
he
proceeded
to
relate
the
episode
of
the
plague
hy
hes
fallen
asleep
he
whispered
all
at
once
to
rkady
pointing
to
evgeny
and
winking
goodnaturedly

get
up
he
went
on
aloud
ets

in
to

lexey
a
goodlooking
stout
man
with
thick
carefullycombed
hair
with
an
embroidered
girdle
round
his
lilac
silk
cassock
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
much
tact
and
adaptability
e
made
haste
to
be
the
first
to
offer
his
hand
to
rkady
and
azarov
as
though
understanding
beforehand
that
they
did
not
want
his
blessing
and
he
behaved
himself
in
general
without
constraint
e
neither
derogated
from
his
own
dignity
nor
gave
offence
to
others
he
vouchsafed
a
passing
smile
at
the
seminary
atin
and
stood
up
for
his
bishop
drank
two
small
glasses
of
wine
but
refused
a
third
accepted
a
cigar
from
rkady
but
did
not
proceed
to
smoke
it
saying
he
would
take
it
home
with
him
he
only
thing
not
quite
agreeable
about
him
was
a
way
he
had
of
constantly
raising
his
hand
with
care
and
deliberation
to
catch
the
flies
on
his
face
sometimes
succeeding
in
smashing
them
e
took
his
seat
at
the
green
table
expressing
his
satisfaction
at
so
doing
in
measured
terms
and
ended
by
winning
from
azarov
two
roubles
and
a
half
in
paper
money
they
had
no
idea
of
even
reckoning
in
silver
in
the
house
of
rina
lasyevna
he
was
sitting
as
before
near
her
son
she
did
not
play
cards
her
cheek
as
before
propped
on
her
little
fist
she
only
got
up
to
order
some
new
dainty
to
be
served
he
was
afraid
to
caress
azarov
and
he
gave
her
no
encouragement
he
did
not
invite
her
caresses
and
besides
assily
vanovitch
had
advised
her
not
to
worry
him
too
much
oung
men
are
not
fond
of
that
sort
of
thing
he
declared
to
her
ts
needless
to
say
what
the
dinner
was
like
that
day
imofeitch
in
person
had
galloped
off
at
early
dawn
for
beef
the
bailiff
had
gone
off
in
another
direction
for
turbot
gremille
and
crayfish
for
mushrooms
alone
fortytwo
farthings
had
been
paid
the
peasant
women
in
copper
but
rina
lasyevnas
eyes
bent
steadfastly
on
azarov
did
not
express
only
devotion
and
tenderness
in
them
was
to
be
seen
sorrow
also
mingled
with
awe
and
curiosity
there
was
to
be
seen
too
a
sort
of
humble
reproachfulnessazarov
however
was
not
in
a
humour
to
analyse
the
exact
expression
of
his
mothers
eyes
he
seldom
turned
to
her
and
then
only
with
some
short
question
nce
he
asked
her
for
her
hand
for
luck
she
gently
laid
her
soft
little
hand
on
his
rough
broad
palmell
she
asked
after
waiting
a
little
has
it
been
any
useorse
luck
than
ever
he
answered
with
a
careless
laughe

too
rashly
pronounced

compassionately

took

with

in
his

and
pulling
out
with
trembling
fingers
one
dogseared

assily
vanovitch
without
turning
round
merely
waved
his
hand
and
was
gone
hen
he
got
back
to
his
bedroom
he
found
his
wife
in
bed
and
began
to
say
his
prayers
in
a
whisper
so
as
not
to
wake
her
up
he
woke
however
s
that
you
assily

askedes

sofa
told
nfisushka
to
put
him
on
your
travelling
mattress
and
the
new

should
have
given
him
our
featherbed
but
seem
to
remember
he
doesnt
like
too
soft
a
bedever
mind
mother
dont
worry
yourself
es
all
right
ord
have
mercy
on
me
a
sinner
he
went
on
with
his
prayer
in
a
low
voice
assily
vanovitch
was
sorry
for
his
old
wife
he
did
not
mean
to
tell
her
over
night
what
a
sorrow
there
was
in
store
for
herazarov
and
rkady
set
off
the
next
day
rom
early
morning
all
was
dejection
in
the
house
nfisushka
let
the
tray
slip
out
of
her
hands
even
edka
was
bewildered
and
was
reduced
to
taking
off
his
boots
assily
vanitch
was
more
fussy
than
ever
he
was
obviously
trying
to
put
a
good
face
on
it
talked
loudly
and
stamped
with
his
feet
but
his
face
looked
haggard
and
his
eyes
were
continually
avoiding
his
son
rina
lasyevna
was
crying
quietly
she
was
utterly
crushed
and
could
not
have
controlled
herself
at
all
if
her
husband
had
not
spent
two
whole
hours
early
in
the
morning
exhorting
her
hen
azarov
after
repeated
promises
to
come
back
certainly
not
later
than
in
a
months
time
tore
himself
at
last
from
the
embraces
detaining
him
and
took
his
seat
in
the
coach
when
the
horses
had
started
the
bell
was
ringing
and
the
wheels
were
turning
round
and
when
it
was
no
longer
any
good
to
look
after
them
and
the
dust
had
settled
and
imofeitch
all
bent
and
tottering
as
he
walked
had
crept
back
to
his
little
room
when
the
old
people
were
left
alone
in
their
little
house
which
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
shrunken
and
decrepit
too
assily
vanovitch
after
a
few
more
moments
of
hearty
waving
of
his
handkerchief
on
the
steps
sank
into
a
chair
and
his
head
dropped
on
to
his
breast
e
has
cast
us
off
he
has
forsaken
us
he
faltered
forsaken
us
he
was
dull
with
us
lone
alone
he
repeated
several
times
hen
rina
lasyevna
went
up
to
him
and
leaning
her
grey
head
against
his
grey
head
said
heres

vanovitch
took
his
hands
from
his
face
and
clasped
his
wife
his
friend
as
warmly
as
he
had
never
clasped
in
youth
she
comforted
him
in
his
grief
n
silence
only
rarely
exchanging
a
few
insignificant
words
our
friends
travelled
as
far
as
edots
azarov
was
not
altogether
pleased
with
himself
rkady
was
displeased
with
him
e
was
feeling
too
that
causeless
melancholy
which
is
only
known
to
very
young
people
he

changed
the

up

rkadyhe
coach
rolled
away
in
the
direction
of
ikolskoe
ut
having
resolved
on
the
folly
the
friends
were
even
more
obstinately
silent
than
before
and
seemed
positively
illhumouredirectly
the
steward
met
them
on
the
steps
of
adame
dintsovs
house
the
friends
could
perceive
that
they
had
acted
injudiciously
in
giving
way
so
suddenly
to
a
passing
impulse
hey
were
obviously
not
expected
hey
sat
rather
a
long
while
looking
rather
foolish
in
the
drawingroom
adame
dintsov
came
in
to
them
at
last
he
greeted
them
with
her
customary
politeness
but
was
surprised
at
their
hasty
return
and
so
far
as
could
be
judged
from
the
deliberation
of
her
gestures
and
words
she
was
not
over
pleased
at
it
hey
made
haste
to
announce
that
they
had
only
called
on
their
road
and
must
go
on
farther
to
the
town
within
four
hours
he
confined
herself
to
a
light
exclamation
begged
rkady
to
remember
her
to
his
father
and
sent
for
her
aunt
he
princess
appeared
very
sleepy
which
gave
her
wrinkled
old
face
an
even
more
illnatured
expression
atya
was
not
well
she
did
not
leave
her
room
rkady
suddenly
realised
that
he
was
at
least
as
anxious
to
see
atya
as
nna
ergyevna
herself
he
four
hours
were
spent
in
insignificant
discussion
of
one
thing
and
another
nna
ergyevna
both
listened
and
spoke
without
a
smile
t
was
only
quite
at
parting
that
her
former
friendliness
seemed
as
it
were
to
revive
have
an
attack
of
spleen
just
now
she
said
but
you
must
not
pay
attention
to
that
and
come
again
say
this
to
both
of
youbefore
longoth
azarov
and
rkady
responded
with
a
silent
bow
took
their
seats
in
the
coach
and
without
stopping
again
anywhere
went
straight
home
to
aryino
where
they
arrived
safely
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
uring
the
whole
course
of
the
journey
neither
one
nor
the
other
even
mentioned
the
name
of
adame
dintsov
azarov
in
particular
scarcely
opened
his
mouth
and
kept
staring
in
a
side
direction
away
from
the
road
with
a
kind
of
exasperated
intensityt
aryino
every
one
was
exceedingly
delighted
to
see
them
he
prolonged
absence
of
his
son
had
begun
to
make
ikolai
etrovitch
uneasy
he
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
bounced
about
on
the
sofa
dangling
his
legs
when
enitchka
ran
to
him
with
sparkling
eyes
and
informed
him
of
the
arrival
of
the
young
gentlemen
even
avel
etrovitch
was
conscious
of
some
degree
of
agreeable
excitement
and
smiled
condescendingly
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
returned
wanderers
alk
questions
followed
rkady
talked
most
especially
at
supper
which
was
prolonged
long
after
midnight
ikolai
etrovitch
ordered
up
some
bottles
of
porter
which
had
only
just
been
sent
from
oscow
and
partook
of
the
festive
beverage
till
his
cheeks
were
crimson
and
he
kept
laughing
in
a
halfchildish
halfnervous
little
chuckle
ven
the
servants
were
infected
by
the
general
gaiety
unyasha
ran
up
and
down
like
one
possessed
and
was
continually
slamming
doors
while
iotr
was
at
three
oclock
in
the
morning
still
attempting
to
strum
a
ossack
waltz
on
the
guitar
he
strings
gave
forth
a
sweet
and
plaintive
sound
in
the
still
air
but
with
the
exception
of
a
small
preliminary
flourish
nothing
came
of
the
cultured
valets
efforts
nature
had
given
him
no
more
musical
talent
than
all
the
rest
of
the
worldut
meanwhile
things
were
not
going
over
harmoniously
at
aryino
and
poor
ikolai
etrovitch
was
having
a
bad
time
of
it
ifficulties
on
the
farm
sprang
up
every
daysenseless
distressing
difficulties
he
troubles
with
the
hired
labourers
had
become
insupportable
ome
asked
for
their
wages
to
be
settled
or
for
an
increase
of
wages
while
others
made
off
with
the
wages
they
had
received
in
advance
the
horses
fell
sick
the
harness
fell
to
pieces
as
though
it
were
burnt
the
work
was
carelessly
done
a
threshing
machine
that
had
been
ordered
from
oscow
turned
out
to
be
useless
from
its
great
weight
another
was
ruined
the
first
time
it
was
used
half
the
cattle
sheds
were
burnt
down
through
an
old
blind
woman
on
the
farm
going
in
windy
weather
with
a
burning
brand
to
fumigate
her
cow
the
old
woman
it
is
true
maintained
that
the
whole
mischief
could
be
traced
to
the
masters
plan
of
introducing
newfangled
cheeses
and
milkproducts
he
overseer
suddenly
turned
lazy
and
began
to
grow
fat
as
every
ussian
grows
fat
when
he
gets
a
snug
berth
hen
he
caught
sight
of
ikolai
etrovitch
in
the
distance
he
would
fling
a
stick
at
a
passing
pig
or
threaten
a
halfnaked
urchin
to
show
his
zeal
but
the
rest
of
the
time
he
was
generally
asleep
he
peasants
who
had
been
put
on
the
rent
system
did
not
bring
their
money
at
the
time
due
and
stole
the
foresttimber
almost
every
night
the
keepers
caught
peasants
horses
in
the
meadows
of
the
farm
and
sometimes
forcibly
bore
them
off
ikolai
etrovitch
would
fix
a
money
fine
for
damages
but
the
matter
usually
ended
after
the
horses
had
been
kept
a
day
or
two
on
the
masters
forage
by
their
returning
to
their
owners
o
crown
all
the
peasants
began
quarrelling
among
themselves
brothers
asked
for
a
division
of
property
their
wives
could
not
get
on
together
in
one
house
all
of
a
sudden
the
squabble
as
though
at
a
given
signal
came
to
a
head
and
at
once
the
whole
village
came
running
to
the
countinghouse
steps
crawling
to
the
master
often
drunken
and
with
battered
face
demanding
justice
and
judgment
then
arose
an
uproar
and
clamour
the
shrill
wailing
of
the
women
mixed
with
the
curses
of
the
men
hen
one
had
to
examine
the
contending
parties
and
shout
oneself
hoarse
knowing
all
the
while
that
one
could
never
anyway
arrive
at
a
just
decision
here
were
not
hands
enough
for
the
harvest
a
neighbouring
small
owner
with
the
most
benevolent
countenance
contracted
to
supply
him
with
reapers
for
a
commission
of
two
roubles
an
acre
and
cheated
him
in
the
most
shameless
fashion
his
peasant
women
demanded
unheardof
sums
and
the
corn
meanwhile
went
to
waste
and
here
they
were
not
getting
on
with
the
mowing
and
there
the
ouncil
of
uardians
threatened
and
demanded
prompt
payment
in
full
of
interest
due
can
do
nothing
ikolai
etrovitch
cried
more
than
once
in
despair
cant
flog
them
myself
and
as
for
calling
in
the
police
captain
my
principles
dont
allow
of
it
while
you
can
do
nothing
with
them
without
the
fear
of
punishmentu
calme
du
calme
avel
etrovitch
would
remark
upon
this
but
even
he
hummed
to
himself
knitted
his
brows
and
tugged
at
his
moustacheazarov
held
aloof
from
these
matters
and
indeed
as
a
guest
it
was
not
for
him
to
meddle
in
other
peoples
business
he
day
after
his
arrival
at
aryino
he
set
to
work
on
his
frogs
his
infusoria
and
his
chemical
experiments
and
was
for
ever
busy
with
them
rkady
on
the
contrary
thought
it
his
duty
if
not
to
help
his
father
at
least
to
make
a
show
of
being
ready
to
help
him
e
gave
him
a
patient
hearing
and
once
offered
him
some
advice
not
with
any
idea
of
its
being
acted
upon
but
to
show
his
interest
arming
details
did
not
arouse
any
aversion
in
him
he
used
even
to
dream
with
pleasure
of
work
on
the
land
but
at
this
time
his
brain
was
swarming
with
other
ideas
rkady
to
his
own
astonishment
thought
incessantly
of
ikolskoe
in
former
days
he
would
simply
have
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
any
one
had
told
him
that
he
could
ever
feel
dull
under
the
same
roof
as
azarovand
that
roof
his
fathers
but
he
actually
was
dull
and
longed
to
get
away
e
tried
going
long
walks
till
he
was
tired
but
that
was
no
use
n
conversation
with
his
father
one
day
he
found
out
that
ikolai
etrovitch
had
in
his
possession
rather
interesting
letters
written
by
adame
dintsovs
mother
to
his
wife
and
he
gave
him
no
rest
till
he
got
hold
of
the
letters
for
which
ikolai
etrovitch
had
to
rummage
in
twenty
drawers
and
boxes
aving
gained
possession
of
these
halfcrumbling
papers
rkady
felt
as
it
were
soothed
just
as
though
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
goal
towards
which
he
ought
now
to
go
mean
that
for
both
of
you
he
was
constantly
whisperingshe
had
added
that
herself
ll
go
ll
go
hang
it
all
ut
he
recalled
the
last
visit
the
cold
reception
and
his
former
embarrassment
and
timidity
got
the
better
of
him
he
goahead
feeling
of
youth
the
secret
desire
to
try
his
luck
to
prove
his
powers
in
solitude
without
the
protection
of
any
one
whatever
gained
the
day
at
last
efore
ten
days
had
passed
after
his
return
to
aryino
on
the
pretext
of
studying
the
working
of
the
unday
schools
he
galloped
off
to
the
town
again
and
from
there
to
ikolskoe
rging
the
driver
on
without
intermission
he
flew
along
like
a
young
officer
riding
to
battle
and
he
felt
both
frightened
and
lighthearted
and
was
breathless
with
impatience
he
great
thing
isone
mustnt
think
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
is
driver
happened
to
be
a
lad
of
spirit
he
halted
before
every
public
house
saying
drink
or
not
a
drink
but
to
make
up
for
it
when
he
had
drunk
he
did
not
spare
his
horses
t
last
the
lofty
roof
of
the
familiar
house
came
in
sight
hat
am
to
do
flashed
through
rkadys
head
ell
theres
no
turning
back
now
he
three
horses
galloped
in
unison
the
driver
whooped
and
whistled
at
them
nd
now
the
bridge
was
groaning
under
the
hoofs
and
wheels
and
now
the
avenue
of
lopped
pines
seemed
running
to
meet
them
here
was
a
glimpse
of
a
womans
pink
dress
against
the
dark
green
a
young
face
from
under
the
light
fringe
of
a
parasol
e
recognised
atya
and
she
recognised
him
rkady
told
the
driver
to
stop
the
galloping
horses
leaped
out
of
the
carriage
and
went
up
to
her
ts

she
cried
gradually
flushing
all
over
let
us
go
to
my
sister
shes
here
in
the
garden
she
will
be
pleased
to
see
youatya
led
rkady
into
the
garden
is
meeting
with
her
struck
him
as
a
particularly
happy
omen
he
was
delighted
to
see
her
as
though
she
were
of
his
own
kindred
verything
had
happened
so
splendidly
no
steward
no
formal
announcement
t
a
turn
in
the
path
he
caught
sight
of
nna
ergyevna
he
was
standing
with
her
back
to
him
earing
footsteps
she
turned
slowly
roundrkady
felt
confused
again
but
the
first
words
she
uttered
soothed
him
at
once
elcome
back
runaway
she
said
in
her
even
caressing
voice
and
came
to
meet
him
smiling
and
frowning
to
keep
the
sun
and
wind
out
of
her
eyes
here
did
you
pick
him
up
atya
have
brought
you
something
nna
ergyevna
he
began
which
you
certainly
dont
expectou
have
brought
yourself
thats
better
than
anything
aving
seen
rkady
off
with
ironical
compassion
and
given
him
to
understand
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
deceived
as
to
the
real
object
of
his
journey
azarov
shut
himself
up
in
complete
solitude
he
was
overtaken
by
a
fever
for
work
e
did
not
dispute
now
with
avel
etrovitch
especially
as
the
latter
assumed
an
excessively
aristocratic
demeanour
in
his
presence
and
expressed
his
opinions
more
in
inarticulate
sounds
than
in
words
nly
on
one
occasion
avel
etrovitch
fell
into
a
controversy
with
the
nihilist
on
the
subject
of
the
question
then
much
discussed
of
the
rights
of
the
nobles
of
the
altic
province
but
suddenly
he
stopped
of
his
own
accord
remarking
with
chilly
politeness
owever
we
can
not
understand
one
another
at
least
have
not
the
honour
of
understanding
you
should
think
not
cried
azarov
mans
capable
of
understanding
anythinghow
the
ther
vibrates
and
whats
going
on
in
the
sunbut
how
any
other
man
can
blow
his
nose
differently
from
him
that
hes
incapable
of
understandinghat
is
that
an
epigram
observed
avel
etrovitch
inquiringly
and
he
walked
awayowever
he
sometimes
asked
permission
to
be
present
at
azarovs
experiments
and
once
even
placed
his
perfumed
face
washed
with
the
very
best
soap
near
the
microscope
to
see
how
a
transparent
infusoria
swallowed
a
green
speck
and
busily
munched
it
with
two
very
rapid
sort
of
clappers
which
were
in
its
throat
ikolai
etrovitch
visited
azarov
much
oftener
than
his
brother
he
would
have
come
every
day
as
he
expressed
it
to
study
if
his
worries
on
the
farm
had
not
taken
off
his
attention
e
did
not
hinder
the
young
man
in
his
scientific
researches
he
used
to
sit
down
somewhere
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
look
on
attentively
occasionally
permitting
himself
a
discreet
question
uring
dinner
and
suppertime
he
used
to
try
to
turn
the
conversation
upon
physics
geology
or
chemistry
seeing
that
all
other
topics
even
agriculture
to
say
nothing
of
politics
might
lead
if
not
to
collisions
at
least
to
mutual
unpleasantness
ikolai
etrovitch
surmised
that
his
brothers
dislike
for
azarov
was
no
less
n
unimportant
incident
among
many
others
confirmed
his
surmises
he
cholera
began
to
make
its
appearance
in
some
places
in
the
neighbourhood
and
even
carried
off
two
persons
from
aryino
itself
n
the
night
avel
etrovitch
happened
to
have
rather
severe
symptoms
e
was
in
pain
till
the
morning
but
did
not
have
recourse
to
azarovs
skill
nd
when
he
met
him
the
following
day
in
reply
to
his
question
hy
he
had
not
sent
for
him
answered
still
quite
pale
but
scrupulously
brushed
and
shaved
hy
seem
to
recollect
you
said
yourself
you
didnt
believe
in
medicine
o
the
days
went
by
azarov
went
on
obstinately
and
grimly
working
and
meanwhile
there
was
in
ikolai
etrovitchs
house
one
creature
to
whom
if
he
did
not
open
his
heart
he
at
least
was
glad
to
talk
hat
creature
was
enitchkae
used
to
meet
her
for
the
most
part
early
in
the
morning
in
the
garden
or
the
farmyard
he
never
used
to
go
to
her
room
to
see
her
and
she
had
only
once
been
to
his
door
to
inquireought
she
to
let
itya
have
his
bath
or
not
t
was
not
only
that
she
confided
in
him
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
himshe
was
positively
freer
and
more
at
her
ease
in
her
behaviour
with
him
than
with
ikolai
etrovitch
himself
t
is
hard
to
say
how
it
came
about
perhaps
it
was
because
she
unconsciously
felt
the
absence
in
azarov
of
all
gentility
of
all
that
superiority
which
at
once
attracts
and
overawes
n
her
eyes
he
was
both
an
excellent
doctor
and
a
simple
man
he
looked
after
her
baby
without
constraint
in
his
presence
and
once
when
she
was
suddenly
attacked
with
giddiness
and
headacheshe
took
a
spoonful
of
medicine
from
his
hand
efore
ikolai
etrovitch
she
kept
as
it
were
at
a
distance
from
azarov
she
acted
in
this
way
not
from
hypocrisy
but
from
a
kind
of
feeling
of
propriety
avel
etrovitch
she
was
more
afraid
of
than
ever
for
some
time
he
had
begun
to
watch
her
and
would
suddenly
make
his
appearance
as
though
he
sprang
out
of
the
earth
behind
her
back
in
his
nglish
suit
with
his
immovable
vigilant
face
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
ts
like
a
bucket
of
cold
water
on
one
enitchka
complained
to
unyasha
and
the
latter
sighed
in
response
and
thought
of
another
heartless
man
azarov
without
the
least
suspicion
of
the
fact
had
become
the
cruel
tyrant
of
her
heartenitchka
liked
azarov
but
he
liked
her
too
is
face
was
positively
transformed
when
he
talked
to
her
it
took
a
bright
almost
kind
expression
and
his
habitual
nonchalance
was
replaced
by
a
sort
of
jesting
attentiveness
enitchka
was
growing
prettier
every
day
here
is
a
time
in
the
life
of
young
women
when
they
suddenly
begin
to
expand
and
blossom
like
summer
roses
this
time
had
come
for
enitchka
ressed
in
a
delicate
white
dress
she
seemed
herself
slighter
and
whiter
she
was
not
tanned
by
the
sun
but
the
heat
from
which
she
could
not
shield
herself
spread
a
slight
flush
over
her
cheeks
and
ears
and
shedding
a
soft
indolence
over
her
whole
body
was
reflected
in
a
dreamy
languor
in
her
pretty
eyes
he
was
almost
unable
to
work
her
hands
seem
to
fall
naturally
into
her
lap
he
scarcely
walked
at
all
and
was
constantly
sighing
and
complaining
with
comic
helplessnessou
should
go
oftener
to
bathe
ikolai
etrovitch
told
her
e
had
made
a
large
bath
covered
in
with
an
awning
in
one
of
his
ponds

had

his

at
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
azarov
returning
from
a
walk
came
upon
enitchka
in
the
lilac
arbour
which
was
long
past
flowering
but
was
still
thick
and
green
he
was
sitting
on
the
garden
seat
and
had
as
usual
thrown
a
white
kerchief
over
her
head
near

lay
a
whole
heap
of
red
and
white
roses

wet
with

raised
her
eyes
which
seemed
still
darker
from
the
whitish
reflection
cast
on
the
upper
part
of
her
face
and
looked
at

laughed
and
at

time
felt
flattered
azarov
was
looking
intently
at

all

said
at

and
bending
down
to

azarov
e
bent
down
and
kissed

vigorously
on

parted
lipshe
started
pushed
him
back
with

her
hands
on

pushed
feebly
and
he
was
able
to
renew
and
prolong

cough

heard
behind

lilac
bushes
enitchka
instantly
moved
away
to

etrovitch
showed
himself

a
slight
bow
and
saying
with
a
sort
of
malicious
mournfulness

he
retreated

at
once
gathered
up
all
her
roses
and
went
out

arbour

she
whispered
as
she
went
here

a
note
of
genuine
reproach
in
her
whisperazarov
remembered
another
recent
scene
and
he
felt
both
shame
and
contemptuous
annoyance
ut
he
shook
his
head
directly
ironically
congratulated
himself
on
his
final
assumption
of
the
part
of
the
gay
othario
and
went
off
to
his
own
roomavel
etrovitch
went
out
of
the
garden
and
made
his
way
with
deliberate
steps
to
the
copse
e
stayed
there
rather
a
long
while
and
when
he
returned
to
lunch
ikolai
etrovitch
inquired
anxiously
whether
he
were
quite
wellhis
face
looked
so
gloomyou
know
sometimes
suffer
with
my
liver
avel
etrovitch
answered
tranquilly
wo
hours
later
he
knocked
at
azarovs
door
must
apologise
for
hindering
you
in
your
scientific
pursuits
he
began
seating
himself
on
a
chair
in
the
window
and
leaning
with
both
hands
on
a
handsome
walkingstick
with
an
ivory
knob
he
usually
walked
without
a
stick
but
am
constrained
to
beg
you
to
spare
me
five
minutes
of
your
time
no
morell
my
time
is
at
your
disposal
answered
azarov
over
whose
face
there
passed
a
quick
change
of
expression
directly
avel
etrovitch
crossed
the
thresholdive
minutes
will
be
enough
for
me
have
come
to
put
a
single
question
to
you
question
hat
is
it
about
will
tell
you
if
you
will
kindly
hear
me
out
t
the
commencement
of
your
stay
in
my
brothers
house
before
had
renounced
the
pleasure
of
conversing
with
you
it
was
my
fortune
to
hear
your
opinions
on
many
subjects
but
so
far
as
my
memory
serves
neither
between
us
nor
in
my
presence
was
the
subject
of
single
combats
and
duelling
in
general
broached
llow
me
to
hear
what
are
your
views
on
that
subjectazarov
who
had
risen
to
meet
avel
etrovitch
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
folded
his
armsy
view
is
he
said
that
from
the
theoretical
standpoint
duelling
is
absurd
from
the
practical
standpoint
nowits
quite
a
different
matterhat
is
you
mean
to
say
if
understand
you
right
that
whatever
your
theoretical
views
on
duelling
you
would
not
in
practice
allow
yourself
to
be
insulted
without
demanding
satisfactionou
have
guessed
my
meaning
absolutelyery
good
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
our
words
relieve
me
from
a
state
of
incertitudef
uncertainty
you
mean
to
sayhat
is
all
the
same
express
myself
so
as
to
be
understood
am
not
a
seminary
rat
our
words
save
me
from
a
rather
deplorable
necessity
have
made
up
my
mind
to
fight
youazarov
opened
his
eyes
wide
endoubtedlyut
what
for
pray
could
explain
the
reason
to
you
began
avel
etrovitch
but
prefer
to
be
silent
about
it
o
my
idea
your
presence
here
is
superfluous
can
not
endure
you
despise
you
and
if
that
is
not
enough
for
you
avel
etrovitchs
eyes
glittered
azarovs
too
were
flashingery
good
he
assented
o
need
of
further
explanations
ouve
a
whim
to
try
your
chivalrous
spirit
upon
me
might
refuse
you
this
pleasure
butso
be
it
am
sensible
of
my
obligation
to
you
replied
avel
etrovitch
and
may
reckon
then
on
your
accepting
my
challenge
without
compelling
me
to
resort
to
violent
measureshat
means
speaking
without
metaphor
to
that
stick
azarov
remarked
coolly
hat
is
precisely
correct
ts
quite
unnecessary
for
you
to
insult
me
ndeed
it
would
not
be
a
perfectly
safe
proceeding
ou
can
remain
a
gentleman
accept
your
challenge
too
like
a
gentlemanhat
is
excellent
observed
avel
etrovitch
putting
his
stick
in
the
corner
e
will
say
a
few
words
directly
about
the
conditions
of
our
duel
but
should
like
first
to
know
whether
you
think
it
necessary
to
resort
to
the
formality
of
a
trifling
dispute
which
might
serve
as
a
pretext
for
my
challengeo
its
better
without
formalities
think
so
myself
presume
it
is
also
out
of
place
to
go
into
the
real
grounds
of
our
difference
e
can
not
endure
one
another
hat
more
is
necessaryhat
more
indeed
repeated
azarov
ironicallys
regards
the
conditions
of
the
meeting
itself
seeing
that

to

put
a
letter
in

pocket
in
which
he
accuses
himself
of
his
endow
that
dont
approve
of
at
all
observed
azarov
heres
a
slight
flavour
of
the
rench
novel
about
it
something
not
very
plausibleerhaps
ou
will
agree
however
that
it
would
be
unpleasant
to
incur
a
suspicion
of
murder
agree
as
to
that
ut
there
is
a
means
of
avoiding

painful
reproach
e

of

in
a
fitting
manner
and
bring

on
to
the
field
of
battleou
persist
in
jesting
still
avel
etrovitch
declared
getting
up
from
his
chair
ut
after
the
courteous
readiness
you
have
shown
me
have
no
right
to
pretend
to
lay
down
nd
so
everything
is
arranged
y
the
way
perhaps

not

a
very
consoling
piece
of
newsavel
etrovitch
took
up
his
stick
nd
now
my
dear

it
only
remains
for
me
to
thank
you
and
to
leave
you

your
studies

the
honour
to
take
leave
of
youill
we
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
again
my
dear
sir
said
azarov
conducting
his
visitor
to
the
dooravel
etrovitch
went
out
while
azarov
remained
standing
a
minute
before
the
door
and
suddenly
exclaimed
ish
well
m
dashed
how
fine
and
how
foolish
pretty
farce
weve
been
through
ike
trained
dogs
dancing
on
their
hindpaws
ut
to
decline
was
out
of
the
question
why
do
believe
hed
have
struck
me
and
then
azarov
turned
white
at
the
very
thought
all
his
pride
was
up
in
arms
at
oncethen
it
might
have
come
to
my
strangling
him
like
a
cat
e
went
back
to
his
microscope
but
his
heart
was
beating
and
the
composure
necessary
for
taking
observations
had
disappeared
e
caught
sight
of
us
today
he
thought
but
would
he
really
act
like
this
on
his
brothers
account
nd
what
a
mighty
matter
is
ita
kiss
here
must
be
something
else
in
it
ah
isnt
he
perhaps
in
love
with
her
himself
o
be
sure
hes
in
love
its
as
clear
as
day
hat
a
complication
ts
a
nuisance
he
decided
at
last
its
a
bad
job
look
at
it
which
way
you
will
n
the
first
place
to
risk
a
bullet
through
ones
brains
and
in
any
case
to
go
away
and
then
rkady
and
that
dear
innocent
pussy
ikolai
etrovitch
ts
a
bad
job
an
awfully
bad
jobhe
day
passed
in
a
kind
of
peculiar
stillness
and
languor
enitchka
gave
no
sign
of
her
existence
she
sat
in
her
little
room
like
a
mouse
in
its
hole
ikolai
etrovitch
had
a
careworn
air
e
had
just
heard
that
blight
had
begun
to
appear
in
his
wheat
upon
which
he
had
in
particular
rested
his
hopes
avel
etrovitch
overwhelmed
every
one
even
rokofitch
with
his
icy
courtesy
azarov
began
a
letter
to
his
father
but
tore
it
up
and
threw
it
under
the
tablef
die
he
thought
they
will
find
it
out
but
m
not
going
to
die
o
shall
struggle
along
in
this
world
a
good
while
yet
e
gave
iotr
orders
to
come
to
him
on
important
business
the
next
morning
directly
it
was
light
iotr
imagined
that
he
wanted
to
take
him
to
etersburg
with
him
azarov
went
late
to
bed
and
all
night
long
he
was
harassed
by
disordered
dreams
adame
dintsov
kept
appearing
in
them
now
she
was
his
mother
and
she
was
followed
by
a
kitten
with
black
whiskers
and
this
kitten
seemed
to
be
enitchka
then
avel
etrovitch
took
the
shape
of
a
great
wood
with
which
he
had
yet
to
fight
iotr
waked
him
up
at
four
oclock
he
dressed
at
once
and
went
out
with
himt
was
a
lovely
fresh
morning
tiny
flecked
clouds
hovered
overhead
in
little
curls
of
foam
on
the
pale
clear
blue
a
fine
dew
lay
in
drops
on
the
leaves
and
grass
and
sparkled
like
silver
on
the
spiders
webs
the
damp
dark
earth
seemed
still
to
keep
traces
of
the
rosy
dawn
from
the
whole
sky
the
songs
of
larks
came
pouring
in
showers
azarov
walked
as
far
as
the
copse
sat
down
in
the
shade
at
its
edge
and
only
then
disclosed
to
iotr
the
nature
of
the
service
he
expected
of
him
he
refined
valet
was
mortally
alarmed
but
azarov
soothed
him
by
the
assurance
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
stand
at
a
distance
and
look
on
and
that
he
would
not
incur
any
sort
of
responsibility
nd
meantime
he
added
only
think
what
an
important
part
you
have
to
play
iotr
threw
up
his
hands
looked
down
and
leaned
against
a
birchtree
looking
green
with
terrorhe
road
from
aryino
skirted
the
copse
a
light
dust
lay
on
it
untouched
by
wheel
or
foot
since
the
previous
day
azarov
unconsciously
stared
along
this
road
picked
and
gnawed
a
blade
of
grass
while
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
hat
a
piece
of
foolery
he
chill
of
the
early
morning
made
him
shiver
twice
iotr
looked
at
him
dejectedly
but
azarov
only
smiled
he
was
not
afraidhe
tramp
of
horses
hoofs
was
heard
along
the
road
peasant
came
into
sight
from
behind
the
trees
e
was
driving
before
him
two
horses
hobbled
together
and
as
he
passed
azarov
he
looked
at
him
rather
strangely
without
touching
his
cap
which
it
was
easy
to
see
disturbed
iotr
as
an
unlucky
omen
heres
some
one
else
up
early
too
thought
azarov
but
he
at
least
has
got
up
for
work
while
we
ancy

gentlemans
coming
iotr
faltered
suddenlyazarov
raised
his
head
and
saw
avel
etrovitch
ressed
in
a
light
check
jacket
and
snowwhite
trousers
he
was
walking
rapidly
along
the
road
under
his
arm
he
carried
a
box
wrapped
up
in
green
cloth
beg
your
pardon
believe
have
kept
you
waiting
he
observed
bowing
first
to
azarov
then
to
iotr
whom
he
treated
respectfully
at
that
instant
as
representing
something
in
the
nature
of
a
second
was
unwilling
to
wake
my
mant

answered
azarov

only

azarov
drew
a
line
on
the
ground
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
heres
the
barrier
then
y
the
way
how
many

repeated
avel
etrovitch
and
he
walked
off
to
his
place
azarov
on
his
side
counted
off
ten
paces
from
the
barrier
and
stood
stillre

moved
slowly
forward
and
avel
etrovitch
his
left
hand
thrust
in
his
pocket
walked
towards
him
gradually
raising
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
es
aiming
straight
at
my
nose
thought
azarov
and
doesnt
he
blink
down
it
carefully
the
ruffian
ot
an
agreeable
sensation
though
m
going
to
look
at
his

whizzed
sharply
by
his
very
ear
and
at
the
same
instant
there
was
the
sound
of
a
shot
heard
it
so
it
must
be
all
right
had
time
to
flash
through
azarovs
brain
e
took
one
more
step
and
without
taking
aim
pressed
the
springavel
etrovitch
gave
a
slight
start
and
clutched
at
his
thigh

of
blood
began
to
trickle
down

trousersazarov
flung
aside
the
pistol
and
went
up
to

antagonist

answered
azarov
catching
hold
of
avel
etrovitch
who
was
beginning
to
turn
pale
ow
m
not
a
duellist
but
a
doctor
and

failed
him
his

azarov
cried
unconsciously
as

etrovitch
on
the
grass

a

e
pulled
out
a
handkerchief
wiped
away

rejoined
azarov
and
as

the
future
its
not

your
head
about
that

shook
iotr
by
the
collar
and
sent
him
for

you
dont

my

avel
etrovitch

to
him
dont

of
informing
himiotr
flew
off
and
while
he
was
running
for
a
droshky
the
two
antagonists
sat
on
the
ground
and
said
nothing
avel
etrovitch
tried
not
to
look
at
azarov
he
did
not
want
to
be
reconciled
to
him
in
any
case
he
was
ashamed
of
his
own
haughtiness
of
his
failure
he
was
ashamed
of
the
whole
position
he
had
brought
about
even
while
he
felt
it
could
not
have
ended
in
a
more
favourable
manner
t
any
rate
there
will
be
no
scandal
he
consoled
himself
by
reflecting
and
for
that
am
thankful
he
silence
was
prolonged
a
silence
distressing
and
awkward
oth
of
them
were
ill
at
ease
ach
was
conscious
that
the
other
understood
him
hat
is
pleasant
to
friends
and
always
very
unpleasant
to
those
who
are
not
friends
especially
when
it
is
impossible
either
to
have
things
out
or
to
separateavent
bound
up
your

too
tight
inquired
azarov
at
lasto
not
at
all
its
capital
answered
avel
etrovitch
and
after
a
brief
pause
he
added
heres
no
deceiving
my
brother
we
shall
have
to
tell
him

assented
azarov
ou

laughed
and
joked

with

had
put
on
a
fine
cambric
nightshirt
an
elegant
morning
wrapper
and
a

sat
the
whole

in

looking
yellow
and
vindictive
and
only
went
in

as

happened
to
meet
enitchka
but
she
shrank
away
from

advised
a
cooling
diet
he
confirmed
however
azarovs
assertion
that
there
was
no

ikolai
etrovitch
told
him

had
wounded
himself
by
accident
to
which
the

responded

that

made
it
impossible
for

to

otherwise
believe
that
you
could
not
avoid
this
duel
which
which
to
some
extent
is
explained
by
the
almost
constant
antagonism
of
your

ikolai
etrovitch
began
to
get
a
little
mixed
up
in
his
words

azarov
in
whom
explanations
and
protestations
of
every

always
aroused
a
feeling
of
impatience
in

dont
beg
you
to
say

to

for

and
accept
the
expression

answered
ikolai
etrovitch
ut
azarov
went
off
without
waiting
for
the
end
of
his
sentencehen
he
heard
of
azarovs
going
avel
etrovitch
expressed
a
desire
to
see
him
and
shook
his
hand
ut
even
then
he
remained
as
cold
as
ice
he
realised
that
avel
etrovitch
wanted
to
play
the
magnanimous
e
did
not
succeed
in
saying
goodbye
to
enitchka
he
only
exchanged
glances
with
her
at
the
window
er
face
struck
him
as
looking
dejected
hell
come
to
grief
perhaps
he
said
to
himself
ut
who
knows
shell
pull
through
somehow
dare
say
iotr
however
was
so
overcome
that
he
wept
on
his
shoulder
till
azarov
damped
him
by
asking
if
hed
a
constant
supply
laid
on
in
his
eyes
while
unyasha
was
obliged
to
run
away
into
the
wood
to
hide
her
emotion
he
originator
of
all
this
woe
got
into
a
light
cart
smoked
a
cigar
and
when
at
the
third
mile
at
the
bend
in
the
road
the
irsanovs
farm
with
its
new
house
could
be
seen
in
a
long
line
he
merely
spat
and
muttering
ursed
snobs
wrapped
himself
closer
in
his
cloakavel
etrovitch
was
soon
better
but
he
had
to
keep
his
bed
about
a
week
e
bore
his
captivity
as
he
called
it
pretty
patiently
though
he
took
great
pains
over
his
toilette
and
had
everything
scented
with

used
to
read

enitchka
waited
on
him
as
before

him
lemonade

boiled
eggs
and
tea
but
she
was
overcome
with
secret
dread
whenever
she
went
into
his
room
avel
etrovitchs
unexpected
action
had
alarmed
every
one
in
the
house
and
her
more
than
any
one
rokofitch
was
the
only
person
not
agitated
by
it
he
discoursed
upon
how
gentlemen
in
his
day
used
to
fight
but
only
with
real
gentlemen
low
curs
like
that
they
used
to
order
a
horsewhipping
in
the
stable
for
their
insolenceenitchkas
conscience
scarcely
reproached
her
but
she
was
tormented
at
times
by
the
thought
of
the
real
cause
of
the
quarrel
and
avel
etrovitch
too
looked
at
her
so
strangely
that
even
when
her
back
was
turned
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
he
grew
thinner
from
constant
inward
agitation

more

etrovitch
avel
etrovitch
himself
put

convulsive

atya
and
rkady
were
sitting
in
the
garden
on
a
turf
seat
in
the
shade
of
a
tall
ash
tree
ifi
had
placed
himself
on
the
ground
near
them
giving
his
slender
body
that
graceful
curve
which
is
known
among
dogfanciers
as
the

silent

was
holding
a
halfopen
book
in
his
hands
while
she
was
picking
out
of
a
basket
the
few
crumbs
of
bread
left
in
it
and
throwing
them
to
a
small
family
of
sparrows
who
with
the
frightened
impudence
peculiar
to
them
were
hopping
and
chirping
at
her
very
feet

in

of

up

down

of

upon

on

silent
but
the
very
way
in
which
they
were
silent
in
which
they
were
sitting
together
was
expressive
of
confidential
intimacy
each
of
them
seemed
not
even
to
be
thinking
of
his
companion
while
secretly
rejoicing
in
his
presence

flung
a

at

all
very
well
he
pursued
but
people
in

in

often
have
that
faculty

is
hard
for
them
as
it

was
taken
aback
and
did
not
at

the

struck
him
suddenly
the

was
not
unpleasing
to
him
ow
nicely
you
said
that
he
commentedhatou
said
it
nicely
simply
without
being
ashamed
or
making
a
boast
of
it
y
the
way
imagine
there
must
always
be
something
special
a
kind
of
pride
of
a
sort
in
the
feeling
of
any
man
who
knows
and
says
he
is
poor
have
never
experienced
anything
of
that
sort
thanks
to
my

referred
to
my

just
now

even
in

inequality

intolerable
o

repeated
after

es

youre
not
nna
ergyevnas

nothing
youre
just
as
independent
as

to
give

to

much
to

my

made
no

turned
away
while
atya
looked
for
a
few
more
crumbs
in
the
basket
and
began
throwing
them
to
the
sparrows
but
she
moved
her
arm
too
vigorously
and
they
flew
away
without
stopping
to
pick
them
upaterina
ergyevna
began
rkady
suddenly
its
of
no
consequence
to
you
probably
but
let
me
tell
you
put
you
not

above
your
sister
but
above
every
one
in
the

up
and
went
quickly
away

though
he
were
frightened
at
the
words
that
had
fallen
from
his
lipsatya
let
her
two
hands
drop
together
with
the
basket
on
to
her
lap
and
with
bent
head
she
stared
a
long
while
after
rkady
radually
a
crimson
flush
came
faintly
out
upon
her
cheeks
but
her
lips
did
not
smile
and
her
dark
eyes
had
a
look
of
perplexity
and
some
other
as
yet
undefined
feelingre
you
alone
she
heard
the
voice
of
nna
ergyevna
near
her
thought
you
came
into
the
garden
with
rkadyatya
slowly
raised
her
eyes
to
her
sister
elegantly
even
elaborately
dressed
she
was
standing
in
the
path
and
tickling
ifis
ears
with
the
tip
of
her
open
parasol
and
slowly
replied

answered
with
a
smile

asking
for

only
yesterday
your
old

about
it
and
you
have
such
charming
little
feet
our

nice
too
though
theyre
large
so
you
must
make
the
most
of
your
little
feet

ergyevna
went
farther
along
the
path
with
a
light
rustle
of
her
beautiful
gown
atya
got
up
from
the
grass
and
taking
eine
with
her
went
away

not

she
thought
as
she
slowly
and
lightly
mounted
the
stone
steps
of
the
terrace
which
were
burning
with
the
heat
of
the
sun

little
feet

call
them

he
shall
be
at

all
at
once
a
feeling
of
shame
came
upon
her
and
she
ran
swiftly
upstairsrkady
had
gone
along
the
corridor
to
his
room
a
steward
had
overtaken
him
and
announced
that
r
azarov
was
in
his
roomevgeny
murmured
rkady
almost
with
dismay
has
he
been
here
longr
azarov
arrived
this
minute
sir
and
gave
orders
not
to
announce
him
to
nna
ergyevna
but
to
show
him
straight
up
to
youan
any
misfortune
have
happened
at
home
thought
rkady
and
running
hurriedly
up
the
stairs
he
at
once
opened
the
door
he
sight
of
azarov
at
once
reassured
him
though
a
more
experienced
eye
might
very
probably
have
discerned
signs
of
inward
agitation
in
the
sunken
though
still
energetic
face
of
the
unexpected
visitor
ith
a
dusty
cloak
over
his
shoulders
with
a
cap
on
his
head
he
was
sitting
at
the
window
he
did
not
even
get
up
when
rkady
flung
himself
with
noisy
exclamations
on
his
neckhis
is
unexpected
hat
good
luck
brought
you
he
kept
repeating
bustling
about
the
room
like
one
who
both
imagines
himself
and
wishes
to
show
himself
delighted
suppose
everythings
all
right
at

ehverythings

not

said
azarov
ont
be
a
chatterbox
but
send
for
some
kvass
for
me
sit
down
and
listen
while
tell
you
all
about
it
in
a
few
but
hope
pretty
vigorous
sentencesrkady
was
quiet
while
azarov
described
his
duel
with
avel
etrovitch
rkady
was
very
much
surprised
and
even
grieved
but
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
show
this
he
only
asked
whether
his
uncles
wound
was
really
not
serious
and
on
receiving
the
reply
that
it
was
most
interesting
but
not
from
a
medical
point
of
view
he
gave
a
forced
smile
but
at
heart
he
felt
both
wounded
and
as
it
were
ashamed
azarov
seemed
to
understand
himes
my
dear
fellow
he
commented
you
see
what
comes
of
living
with
feudal
personages
ou
turn
a
feudal
personage
yourself
and
find
yourself
taking
part
in
knightly
tournaments
ell
so
set
off
for
my
fathers
azarov
wound
up
and
ve
turned
in
here
on
the
way
to
tell
you
all
this
should
say
if

useless
lie
a
piece
of
foolery
o
turned
in
herethe
devil
only

why
ou
see
its
sometimes
a
good
thing
for
a
man
to
take
himself
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
pull
himself
up
like
a
radish
out
of
its
bed
thats
what
ve
been
doing
of
late
ut
wanted
to
have

more
look
at

giving

with
some
emotion

of
absolute
indifference

rkady

changed
his

before
going
to

turned
out
that
he

unexpectedly

hastened
to
say
before
everything
else
must
set
your
mind
at
rest
efore
you
is
a
poor
mortal
who
has
come
to
his
senses
long
ago
and
hopes
other
people
too
have
forgotten
his
follies
am
going
away
for
a
long
while
and
though
as
you
will
allow
m
by
no
means
a
very
soft
creature
it
would
be
anything
but
cheerful
for
me
to
carry
away
with
me
the
idea
that
you
remember
me
with
repugnancenna
ergyevna
gave
a
deep
sigh
like
one
who
has
just
climbed
up
a
high
mountain
and
her
face
was
lighted
up
by
a
smile
he
held
out
her
hand
a
second
time
to
azarov
and
responded
to
his
pressureet
bygones
be
bygones
she
said
am
all
the
readier
to
do
so
because
speaking
from
my
conscience
was
to
blame
then
too
for
flirting
or
something
n
a
word
let
us
be
friends
as
before
hat
was
a
dream
wasnt
it
nd
who
remembers
dreamsho
remembers
them
nd
besides
love
you
know
is
a
purely
imaginary
feelingeally
am
very
glad
to
hear
thato
nna
ergyevna
spoke
and
so
spoke
azarov
they
both
supposed
they
were
speaking
the
truth
as
the
truth
the
whole
truth
to
be
found
in
their
words
hey
could
not
themselves
have
said
and
much
less
could
the
author
ut
a
conversation
followed
between
them
precisely
as
though
they
completely
believed
one
anothernna
ergyevna
asked
azarov
among
other
things
what
he
had
been
doing
at
the
irsanovs
e
was
on
the
point
of
telling
her
about
his
duel
with
avel
etrovitch
but
he
checked
himself
with
the
thought
that
she
might
imagine
he
was
trying
to
make
himself
interesting
and
answered
that
he
had
been
at
work
all
the
timend
observed
nna
ergyevna
had
a
fit
of
depression
at
first
goodness
knows
why
even
made
plans
for
going
abroad
fancy
hen
it
passed
off
your
friend
rkady
ikolaitch
came
and
fell
back
into
my
old
routine
and
took
up
my
real
part
againhat
part
is
that
may
askhe
character
of
aunt
guardian
mothercall
it
what
you
like
y
the
way
do
you
know
used
not
quite
to
understand
your
close
friendship
with
rkady
ikolaitch
thought
him
rather
insignificant
ut
now
have
come
to
know
him
better
and
to
see
that
he
is
clever
nd
hes
young
hes
young
thats
the
great
thing
not
like
you
and
me
evgeny
assilyitchs
he
still
as
shy
in
your
company
queried
azarovhy
was
he
nna
ergyevna
began
and
after
a
brief
pause
she
went
on
e
has
grown
more
confiding
now
he
talks
to
me
e
used
to
avoid
me
before
hough
indeed
didnt
seek
his
society
either
es
more
friends
with
atyaazarov
felt
irritated
woman
cant
help
humbugging
of
course
he
thought
ou
say
he
used
to
avoid
you
he
said
aloud
with
a
chilly
smile
but
it
is
probably
no
secret
to
you
that
he
was
in
love
with
youhat
he
too
fell
from
nna
ergyevnas
lipse
too
repeated
azarov
with
a
submissive
bow
an
it
be
you
didnt
know
it
and
ve
told
you
something
newnna
ergyevna
dropped
her
eyes
ou
are
mistaken
evgeny
assilyitch
dont
think
so
ut
perhaps
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
it
nd
dont
you
try
telling
me
lies
again
for
the
future
he
added
to
himselfhy
not
ut
imagine
that
in
this
too
you
are
attributing
too
much
importance
to
a
passing
impression
begin
to
suspect
you
are
inclined
to
exaggeratione
had
better
not
talk
about
it
nna
ergyevnah
why
she
retorted
but
she
herself
led
the
conversation
into
another
channel
he
was
still
ill
at
ease
with
azarov
though
she
had
told
him
and
assured
herself
that
everything
was
forgotten
hile
she
was
exchanging
the
simplest
sentences
with
him
even
while
she
was
jesting
with
him
she
was
conscious
of
a
faint
spasm
of
dread
o
people
on
a
steamer
at
sea
talk
and
laugh
carelessly
for
all
the
world
as
though
they
were
on
dry
land
but
let
only
the
slightest
hitch
occur
let
the
least
sign
be
seen
of
anything
out
of
the
common
and
at
once
on
every
face
there
comes
out
an
expression
of
peculiar
alarm
betraying
the
constant
consciousness
of
constant
dangernna
ergyevnas
conversation
with
azarov
did
not
last
long
he
began
to
seem
absorbed
in
thought
answered
abstractedly
and
suggested
at
last
that
they
should
go
into
the
hall
where
they
found
the
princess
and
atya
ut
where
is
rkady
ikolaitch
inquired
the
lady
of
the
house
and
on
hearing
that
he
had
not
shown
himself
for
more
than
an
hour
she
sent
for
him
e
was
not
very
quickly
found
he
had
hidden
himself
in
the
very
thickest
part
of
the
garden
and
with
his
chin
propped
on
his
folded
hands
he
was
sitting
lost
in
meditation
hey
were
deep
and
serious
meditations
but
not
mournful
e
knew
nna
ergyevna
was
sitting
alone
with
azarov
and
he
felt
no
jealousy
as
once
he
had
on
the
contrary
his
face
slowly
brightened
he
seemed
to
be
at
once
wondering
and
rejoicing
and
resolving
on
something
he
deceased
dintsov
had
not
liked
innovations
but
he
had
tolerated
the
fine
arts
within
a
certain
sphere
and
had
in
consequence
put
up
in
his
garden
between
the
hothouse
and
the
lake
an
erection
after
the
fashion
of
a
reek
temple
made
of
ussian
brick
long
the
dark
wall
at
the
back
of
this
temple
or
gallery
were
placed
six
niches
for
statues
which
dintsov
had
proceeded
to
order
from
abroad
hese
statues
were
to
represent
olitude
ilence
editation
elancholy
odesty
and
ensibility
ne
of
them
the
goddess
of
ilence
with
her
finger
on
her
lip
had
been
sent
and
put
up
but
on
the
very
same
day
some
boys
on
the
farm
had
broken
her
nose
and
though
a
plasterer
of
the
neighbourhood
undertook
to
make
her
a
new
nose
twice
as
good
as
the
old
one
dintsov
ordered
her
to
be
taken
away
and
she
was
still
to
be
seen
in
the
corner
of
the
threshing
barn
where
she
had
stood
many
long
years
a
source
of
superstitious
terror
to
the
peasant
women
he
front
part
of
the
temple
had
long
ago
been
overgrown
with
thick
bushes
only
the
pediments
of
the
columns
could
be
seen
above
the
dense
green
n
the
temple
itself
it
was
cool
even
at
midday
nna
ergyevna
had
not
liked
visiting
this
place
ever
since
she
had
seen
a
snake
there
but
atya
often
came
and
sat
on
the
wide
stone
seat
under
one
of
the
niches
ere
in
the
midst
of
the
shade
and
coolness
she
used
to
read
and
work
or
to
give
herself
up
to
that
sensation
of
perfect
peace
known
doubtless
to
each
of
us
the
charm
of
which
consists
in
the
halfunconscious
silent
listening
to
the
vast
current
of
life
that
flows
for
ever
both
around
us
and
within
ushe
day
after
azarovs
arrival
atya
was
sitting
on
her
favourite
stone
seat
and
beside
her
again
was
sitting
rkady
e
had
besought
her
to
come
with
him
to
the
templehere
was
about
an
hour
still
to
lunchtime
the
dewy
morning
had
already
given
place
to
a
sultry
day
rkadys
face
retained
the
expression
of
the
preceding
day
atya
had
a
preoccupied
look
er
sister
had
directly
after
their
morning
tea
called
her
into
her
room
and
after
some
preliminary
caresses
which
always
scared
atya
a
little
she
had
advised
her
to
be
more
guarded
in
her
behaviour
with
rkady
and
especially
to
avoid
solitary
talks
with
him
as
likely
to
attract
the
notice
of
her
aunt
and
all
the
household
esides
this
even
the
previous
evening
nna
ergyevna
had
not
been
herself
and
atya
herself
had
felt
ill
at
ease
as
though
she
were
conscious
of
some
fault
in
herself
s
she
yielded
to
rkadys
entreaties
she
said
to
herself
that
it
was
for
the
last
timeaterina
ergyevna
he
began
with
a
sort
of
bashful
easiness
since
ve
had
the
happiness
of
living
in
the
same
house
with
you
have
discussed
a
great
many
things
with
you
but
meanwhile
there
is
one
very
important
for
me
one
question
which
have
not
touched
upon
up
till
now
ou
remarked
yesterday
that
have
been
changed
here
he
went
on
at
once
catching
and
avoiding
the
questioning
glance
atya
was
turning
upon
him
have
changed
certainly
a
great
deal
and
you
know
that
better
than
any
one
elseyou
to
whom
really
owe
this
change
e
said
atya
am
not
now
the
conceited
boy
was
when
came
here
rkady
went
on
ve
not
reached
twentythree
for
nothing
as
before
want
to
be
useful
want
to
devote
all
my
powers
to
the
truth
but
no
longer
look
for
my
ideals
where
did
they
present
themselves
to
me
much
closer
to
hand
p
till
now
did
not
understand
myself
set
myself
tasks
which
were
beyond
my
powers
y
eyes
have
been
opened
lately
thanks
to
one
feeling
m
not
expressing
myself
quite
clearly
but
hope
you
understand
meatya
made
no
reply
but
she
ceased
looking
at
rkady
suppose
he
began
again
this
time
in
a
more
agitated
voice
while
above
his
head
a
chaffinch
sang
its
song
unheeding
among
the
leaves
of
the
birch
suppose
its
the
duty
of
every
one
to
be
open
with
those
with
those
people
who
in
fact
with
those
who
are
near
to
him
and
so
resolved
ut
here
rkadys
eloquence
deserted
him
he
lost
the
thread
stammered
and
was
forced
to
be
silent
for
a
moment
atya
still
did
not
raise
her
eyes
he
seemed
not
to
understand
what
he
was
leading
up
to
in
all
this
and
to
be
waiting
for
something
foresee
shall
surprise
you
began
rkady
pulling
himself
together
again
with
an
effort
especially
since
this
feeling
relates
in
a
way
in
a
way
notice
to
you
ou
reproached
me
if
you
remember
yesterday
with
a
want
of
seriousness
rkady
went
on
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
got
into
a
bog
feels
that
he
is
sinking
further
and
further
in
at
every
step
and
yet
hurries
onwards
in
the
hope
of
crossing
it
as
soon
as
possible
that
reproach
is
often
aimed
often
falls
on
young
men
even
when
they
cease
to
deserve
it
and
if
had
more
selfconfidence
ome
help
me
do
help
me
rkady
was
thinking
in
desperation
but
as
before
atya
did
not
turn
her
head
f
could
hope
f
could
feel
sure
of
what
you
say
was
heard
at
that
instant
the
clear
voice
of
nna
ergyevnarkady
was
still
at
once
while
atya
turned
pale
lose
by
the
bushes
that
screened
the
temple
ran
a
little
path
nna
ergyevna
was
walking
along
it
escorted
by
azarov
atya
and
rkady
could
not
see
them
but
they
heard
every
word
the
rustle
of
their
clothes
their
very
breathing
hey
walked
on
a
few
steps
and
as
though
on
purpose
stood
still
just
opposite
the
templeou
see
pursued
nna
ergyevna
you
and
made
a
mistake
we
are
both
past
our
first
youth
especially
so
we
have
seen
life
we
are
tired
we
are
bothwhy
affect
not
to
know
itclever
at
first
we
interested
each
other
curiosity
was
aroused
and
then
nd
then
grew
stale
put
in
azarovou
know
that
was
not
the
cause
of
our
misunderstanding
ut
however
it
was
to
be
we
had
no
need
of
one
another
thats
the
chief
point
there
was
too
much
what
shall
say
that
was
alike
in
us
e
did
not
realise
it
all
at
once
ow
rkady
o
you
need
him
queried
azarovush
evgeny
assilyitch
ou
tell
me
he
is
not
indifferent
to
me
and
it
always
seemed
to
me
he
liked
me
know
that
might
well
be
his
aunt
but
dont
wish
to
conceal
from
you
that
have
come
to
think
more
often
of
him
n
such
youthful
fresh
feeling
there
is
a
special
charm
he
word
fascination
is
most
usual
in
such
cases
azarov
interrupted
the
effervescence
of
his
spleen
could
be
heard
in
his
choked
though
steady
voice
rkady
was
mysterious
over
something
with
me
yesterday
and
didnt
talk
either
of
you
or
your
sister
hats
a
serious
symptome
is
just
like
a
brother
with
atya
commented
nna
ergyevna
and
like
that
in
him
though
perhaps
ought
not
to
have
allowed
such
intimacy
between
themhat
idea
is
prompted
by
your
feelings
as
a
sister
azarov
brought
out
drawlingf
course
but
why
are
we
standing
still
et
us
go
on
hat
a
strange
talk
we
are
having
arent
we
could
never
have
believed
should
talk
to
you
like
this
ou
know
am
afraid
of
you
and
at
the
same
time
trust
you
because
in
reality
you
are
so
goodn
the
first
place
am
not
in
the
least
good
and
in
the
second
place
have
lost
all
significance
for
you
and
you
tell
me
am
good
ts
like
a
laying
a
wreath
of
flowers
on
the
head
of
a
corpseevgeny
assilyitch
we
are
not
responsible
nna
ergyevna
began
but
a
gust
of
wind
blew
across
set
the
leaves
rustling
and
carried
away
her
words
f
course
you
are
free
azarov
declared
after
a
brief
pause
othing
more
could
be
distinguished
the
steps
retreated
everything
was
stillrkady
turned
to
atya
he
was
sitting
in
the
same
position
but
her
head
was
bent
still
lower
aterina
ergyevna
he
said
with
a
shaking
voice
and
clasping
his
hands
tightly
together
love
you
for
ever
and
irrevocably
and
love
no
one
but
you
wanted
to
tell
you
this
to
find
out
your
opinion
of
me
and
to
ask
for
your
hand
since
am
not
rich
and
feel
ready
for
any
sacrifice
ou
dont
answer
me
ou
dont
believe
me
o
you
think
speak
lightly
ut
remember
these
last
days
urely
for
a
long
time
past
you
must
have
known
that
everythingunderstand
meeverything
else
has
vanished
long
ago
and
left
no
trace
ook
at
me
say
one
word
to
me
love
love
you
believe
meatya
glanced
at
rkady
with
a
bright
and
serious
look
and
after
long
hesitation
with
the
faintest
smile
she
said
esrkady
leapt
up
from
the
stone
seat
es
ou
said
es
aterina
ergyevna

does
that
word
mean
nly
that
do
love
you
that
you
believe
me
or
or
darent
go
on
es
repeated
atya
and
this
time
he
understood
her
e
snatched
her
large
beautiful
hands
and
breathless
with
rapture
pressed
them
to
his
heart
e
could
scarcely
stand
on
his
feet
and
could
only
repeat
atya
atya
while
she
began
weeping
in
a
guileless
way
smiling
gently
at
her
own
tears
o
one
who
has
not
seen
those
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
beloved
knows
yet
to
what
a
point
faint
with
shame
and
gratitude
a
man
may
be
happy
on
earthhe
next
day
early
in
the
morning
nna
ergyevna
sent
to
summon
azarov
to
her
boudoir
and
with
a
forced
laugh
handed
him
a
folded
sheet
of
notepaper
t
was
a
letter
from
rkady
in
it
he
asked
for
her
sisters
handazarov
quickly
scanned
the
letter
and
made
an
effort
to
control
himself
that
he
might
not
show
the
malignant
feeling
which
was
instantaneously
aflame
in
his
breasto
thats
how
it
is
he
commented
and
you
fancy
only
yesterday
imagined
he
loved
aterina
ergyevna
as
a
brother
hat
are
you
intending
to
do
nowhat
do
you
advise
me
asked
nna
ergyevna
still
laughingell
suppose
answered
azarov
also
with
a
laugh
though
he
felt
anything
but
cheerful
and
had
no
more
inclination
to
laugh
than
she
had
suppose
you
ought
to
give
the
young
people
your
blessing
ts
a
good
match
in
every
respect
irsanovs

is
passable

the
only
son

goodnatured
fellow

walked
up
and
down
the
room

azarov
and
he
too
laughed
oodbye
he
began
again
after
a
short
silence
hope
you
will
bring
the
matter
to
the
most
satisfactory

dintsov
turned
quickly
to
him
ou
are
not
going
away
hy
should
you
not
stay
now
tay
its
exciting
talking
to
you
one
seems
walking
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
t
first
one
feels
timid
but
one
gains
courage
as
one
goes
on
o
stayhanks
for
the
suggestion
nna
ergyevna
and
for
your
flattering
opinion
of
my
conversational
talents
ut
think
have
already
been
moving
too
long
in
a
sphere
which
is
not
my
own
lying
fishes
can
hold
out
for
a

soon
they
must

to

dintsov
looked
at
azarov
is
pale
face
was
twitching
with
a
bitter
smile
his
man
did
love
me
she
thought
and
she
felt
pity
for
him
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
sympathyut
he
too
understood
her
o
he
said
stepping
back
a
pace
m
a
poor
man
but
ve
never
taken
charity
so
far
oodbye
and
good
luck
to
you
am
certain
we
are
not
seeing
each
other
for
the
last
time
nna
ergyevna
declared
with
an
unconscious
gesturenything
may
happen
answered
azarov
and
he
bowed
and
went
awayo
you
are
thinking
of
making
yourself
a
nest
he
said
the
same
day
to
rkady
as
he
packed
his
box
crouching
on
the
floor
ell
its
a
capital
thing
ut
you
neednt
have
been
such
a
humbug
expected
something
from
you
in
quite
another
quarter
erhaps
though
it
took
you
by
surprise
yourself
certainly
didnt
expect
this
when
parted
from
you
answered
rkady
but
why
are
you
a
humbug
yourself
calling
it
a
capital
thing
as
though
didnt
know
your
opinion
of
marriageh
my
dear
fellow
said
azarov
how
you
talk
ou
see
what
m
doing
there
seems
to
be
an
empty
space
in
the
box
and
am
putting
hay
in
thats
how
it
is
in
the
box
of
our
life
we
would
stuff
it
up
with
anything
rather
than
have
a
void
ont
be
offended
please
you
remember
no
doubt
the
opinion
have
always
had
of
aterina
ergyevna
any
a
young
ladys
called
clever
simply
because
she
can
sigh
cleverly
but
yours
can
hold
her
own
and
indeed
shell
hold
it
so
well
that
shell
have
you
under
her
thumbto
be
sure
though
thats
quite
as
it
ought
to
be
e
slammed
the
lid
to
and
got
up
from
the
floor
nd
now
say
again
goodbye
for
its
useless
to
deceive
ourselveswe
are
parting
for
good
and
you
know
that
yourself
you
have
acted
sensibly
youre
not
made
for
our
bitter
rough
lonely
existence
heres
no
dash
no
hate
in
you
but
youve
the
daring
of
youth
and
the
fire
of
youth
our
sort
you
gentry
can
never
get
beyond
refined
submission
or
refined
indignation
and
thats
no
good
ou
wont
fightand
yet
you
fancy
yourselves
gallant
chapsbut
we
mean
to
fight
h
well
ur
dust

get
into
your

our
mud
would
bespatter
you
but
yet
youre
not
up
to
our
level
youre
admiring
yourselves
unconsciously
you
like
to
abuse
yourselves
but
were
sick
of
thatwe
want
something

we
want
to
smash
other
people
oure

sugary
liberal
snob

responded
rkady
mournfully
and
have

the
back
of
his
head
es
rkady
yes

other
things

said
goodbye
to
every
one

now
embracing
ehrkady
flung
himself
on
the
neck
of
his
former
leader
and
friend
and
the
tears
fairly
gushed
from
his
eyeshats
what

azarov
commented
calmly
ut

my
hopes
on
aterina
ergyevna
oull
see
how
quickly
shell
console
you
oodbye
brother
he
said
to
rkady
when
he
had
got
into
the
light
cart
and
pointing
to
a
pair
of
jackdaws
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
stable
roof
he
added
hats
for
you

that
examplehat
does
that
mean
asked
rkadyhat
re
you
so
weak
in
natural
history
or
have
you

that
the
jackdaw
is
a
most
respectable
family

to
you
oodbyehe
cart
creaked
and
rolled
awayazarov
had
spoken
truly
n
talking
that
evening
with
atya
rkady
completely
forgot
about
his
former
teacher
e
already
began
to
follow
her
lead
and
atya
was
conscious
of
this
and
not
surprised
at
it
e
was
to
set
off
the
next
day
for
aryino
to
see
ikolai
etrovitch
nna
ergyevna
was
not
disposed
to
put
any
constraint
on
the
young
people
and
only
on
account
of
the
proprieties
did
not
leave
them
by
themselves
for
too
long
together
he
magnanimously
kept
the
princess
out
of
their
way
the
latter
had
been
reduced
to
a
state
of
tearful
frenzy
by
the
news
of
the
proposed
marriage
t
first
nna
ergyevna
was
afraid
the
sight
of
their
happiness
might
prove
rather
trying
to
herself
but
it
turned
out
quite
the
other
way
this
sight
not
only
did
not
distress
her
it
interested
her
it
even
softened
her
at
last
nna
ergyevna
felt
both
glad
and
sorry
at
this
t
is
clear
that
azarov
was
right
she
thought
it
has
been
curiosity
nothing
but
curiosity
and
love
of
ease
and
egoism
hildren
she
said
aloud
what
do
you
say
is
love
a
purely
imaginary
feelingut
neither
atya
nor
rkady
even
understood
her
hey
were
shy
with
her
the
fragment
of
conversation
they
had
involuntarily
overheard
haunted
their
minds
ut
nna
ergyevna
soon
set
their
minds
at
rest
and
it
was
not
difficult
for
hershe
had
set
her
own
mind
at
rest
azarovs
old
parents
were
all
the
more
overjoyed
by
their
sons
arrival
as
it
was
quite
unexpected
rina
lasyevna
was
greatly
excited
and
kept
running
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
house
so
that
assily
vanovitch
compared
her
to
a
hen
partridge
the
short
tail
of
her
abbreviated
jacket
did
in
fact
give
her
something
of
a
birdlike
appearance
e
himself
merely
growled
and
gnawed
the
amber
mouthpiece
of
his
pipe
or
clutching
his
neck
with
his
fingers
turned
his
head
round
as
though
he
were
trying
whether
it
were
properly
screwed
on
then
all
at
once
he
opened
his
wide
mouth
and
went
off
into
a
perfectly
noiseless
chuckleve
come
to
you
for
six
whole
weeks
governor
azarov
said
to
him
want
to
work
so
please
dont
hinder
me
nowou
shall
forget
my
face
completely
if
you
call
that
hindering
you
answered
assily
vanovitche
kept
his
promise
fter
installing
his
son
as
before
in
his
study
he
almost
hid
himself
away
from
him
and
he
kept
his
wife
from
all
superfluous
demonstrations
of
tenderness
n
nyushas
first
visit
my
dear
soul
he
said
to
her
we
bothered
him
a
little
we
must
be
wiser
this
time
rina
lasyevna
agreed
with
her
husband
but
that
was
small
compensation
since
she
saw
her
son
only
at
meals
and
was
now
absolutely
afraid
to
address
him
nyushenka
she
would
say
sometimesand
before
he
had
time
to
look
round
she
was
nervously
fingering
the
tassels
of
her
reticule
and
faltering
ever
mind
never
mind
only
and
afterwards
she
would
go
to
assily
vanovitch
and
her
cheek
in
her
hand
would
consult
him
f
you
could
only
find
out
darling
which
nyusha
would
like
for
dinner
todaycabbagebroth
or
beetrootsouput
why
didnt
you
ask
him
yourselfh
he
will
get
sick
of
me
azarov
however
soon
ceased
to
shut
himself
up
the
fever
of
work
fell
away
and
was
replaced
by
dreary
boredom
or
vague
restlessness
strange
weariness
began
to
show
itself
in
all
his
movements
even
his
walk
firm
bold
and
strenuous
was
changed
e
gave
up
walking
in
solitude
and
began
to
seek
society
he
drank
tea
in
the
drawingroom
strolled
about
the
kitchengarden
with
assily
vanovitch
and
smoked
with
him
in
silence
once
even
asked
after
ather
lexey
assily
vanovitch
at
first
rejoiced
at
this
change
but
his
joy
was
not
longlived
nyushas
breaking
my
heart
he
complained
in
secret
to
his
wife
its
not
that
hes
discontented
or
angrythat
would
be
nothing
hes
sad
hes
sorrowfulthats
whats
so
terrible
es
always
silent
f
hed
only
abuse

hes
growing
thin
hes
lost
his
colourercy
on
us
mercy
on
us
whispered
the
old
woman
would
put
an
amulet
on
his
neck
but
of
course
he
wont
allow
it
assily
vanovitch
several
times
attempted
in
the
most
circumspect
manner
to
question
azarov
about
his
work
about
his
health
and
about
rkady
ut
azarovs
replies
were
reluctant
and
casual
and
once
noticing
that
his
father
was
trying
gradually
to
lead
up
to
something
in
conversation
he
said
to
him
in
a
tone
of
vexation
hy
do
you
always
seem
to
be
walking
round
me
on
tiptoe
hat
ways
worse
than
the
old
onehere
there
meant
nothing
poor
assily
vanovitch
answered
hurriedly
o
his
diplomatic
hints
remained
fruitless
e
hoped
to
awaken
his
sons
sympathy
one
day
by
beginning
propos
of
the
approaching
emancipation
of
the
peasantry
to
talk
about
progress
but
the
latter
responded
indifferently
esterday
was
walking
under
the
fence
and
heard
the
peasant
boys
here
instead
of
some
old
ballad
bawling
a
street
song
hats
what
progress
isometimes
azarov
went
into
the
village
and
in
his
usual
bantering
tone
entered
into
conversation
with
some
peasant
ome
he
would
say
to
him
expound
your
views
on
life
to
me
brother
you
see
they
say
all
the
strength
and
future
of
ussia
lies
in
your
hands
a
new
epoch
in
history
will
be
started
by
youyou
give
us
our
real
language
and
our
lawshe
peasant
either
made
no
reply
or
articulated
a
few
words
of
this
sort
ell
well
try
because
you
see
to
be
sureou
explain
to
me
what
your
mir
is
azarov
interrupted
and
is
it
the
same
mir
that
is
said
to
rest
on
three
fisheshat
little
father
is
the
earth
that
rests
on
three
fishes
the
peasant
would
declare
soothingly
in
a
kind
of
patriarchal
simplehearted
singsong
and
over
against
ours
thats
to
say
the
mir
we
know
theres
the
masters
will
wherefore
you
are
our
fathers
nd
the
stricter
the
masters
rule
the
better
for
the
peasantfter
listening
to
such
a
reply
one
day
azarov
shrugged
his
shoulders
contemptuously
and
turned
away
while
the
peasant
sauntered
slowly
homewardshat
was
he
talking
about
inquired
another
peasant
of
middle
age
and
surly
aspect
who
at
a
distance
from
the
door
of
his
hut
had
been
following
his
conversation
with
azarovrrears
ehrrears
no
indeed
mate
answered
the
first
peasant
and
now
there
was
no
trace
of
patriarchal
singsong
in
his
voice
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
certain
scornful
gruffness
to
be
heard
in
it
h
he
clacked
away
about
something
or
other
wanted
to
stretch
his
tongue
a
bit
f
course
hes
a
gentleman
what
does
he
understandhat
should
he
understand
answered
the
other
peasant
and
jerking
back
their
caps
and
pushing
down
their
belts
they
proceeded
to
deliberate
upon
their
work
and
their
wants
las
azarov
shrugging
his
shoulders
contemptuously
azarov
who
knew
how
to
talk
to
peasants
as
he
had
boasted
in
his
dispute
with
avel
etrovitch
did
not
in
his
selfconfidence
even
suspect
that
in
their
eyes
he
was
all
the
while
something
of
the
nature
of
a
buffooning
clowne
found
employment
for
himself
at
last
however
ne
day
assily
vanovitch
bound
up
a
peasants
wounded
leg
before
him
but
the
old
mans
hands
trembled
and
he
could
not
manage
the
bandages
his
son
helped
him
and
from
time
to
time
began
to
take
a
share
in
his
practice
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
constantly
sneering
both
at
the
remedies
he
himself
advised
and
at
his
father
who
hastened
to
make
use
of
them
ut
azarovs
jeers
did
not
in
the
least
perturb
assily
vanovitch
they
were
positively
a
comfort
to
him
olding
his
greasy
dressinggown
across
his
stomach
with
two
fingers
and
smoking
his
pipe
he
used
to
listen
with
enjoyment
to
azarov
and
the
more
malicious
his
sallies
the
more
goodhumouredly
did
his
delighted
father
chuckle
showing
every
one
of
his
black
teeth
e
used
even
to
repeat
these
sometimes
flat
or
pointless
retorts
and
would
for
instance
for
several
days
constantly
without
rhyme
or
reason
reiterate
ot
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
simply
because
his
son
on
hearing
he
was
going
to
matins
had
made
use
of
that
expression
hank
od
he
has
got
over
his
melancholy
he
whispered
to
his
wife
how
he
gave
it
to
me
today
it
was
splendid
oreover
the
idea
of
having
such
an
assistant
excited
him
to
ecstasy
filled
him
with
pride
es
yes
he
would
say
to
some
peasant
woman
in
a
mans
cloak
and
a
cap
shaped
like
a
horn
as
he
handed
her
a
bottle
of
oulards
extract
or
a
box
of
white
ointment
you
ought
to
be
thanking
od
my
good
woman
every
minute
that
my
son
is
staying
with
me
you
will
be
treated
now
by
the
most
scientific
most
modern
method
o

what
that
means

mperor
of
the
rench
apoleon
even
has
no
better
doctor
nd
the
peasant
woman
who
had
come
to
complain
that
she
felt
so
sort
of
queer
all
over
the
exact
meaning
of
these
words
she
was
not
able
however
herself
to
explain
merely
bowed
low
and
rummaged
in
her
bosom
where
four
eggs
lay
tied
up
in
the
corner
of
a
towelazarov
once
even
pulled
out
a
tooth
for
a
passing
pedlar
of
cloth
and
though
this
tooth
was
an
average
specimen
assily
vanovitch
preserved
it
as
a
curiosity
and
incessantly
repeated
as
he
showed
it
to
ather
lexey
ust
look
what
a
fang
he
force

has
he
pedlar

to
leap

what

to

and
how
to
get
rid
of
the
ecstatic
old
manne
day
a
peasant
from
a
neighbouring
village
brought
his
brother
to
assily
vanovitch
ill
with
typhus
he
unhappy
man
lying
flat
on
a
truss
of
straw
was
dying
his
body
was
covered
with
dark
patches
he
had
long
ago
lost
consciousness
assily
vanovitch
expressed
his
regret
that
no
one
had
taken
steps
to
procure
medical
aid
sooner
and
declared
there
was
no
hope
nd
in
fact
the
peasant
did
not
get
his
brother
home
again
he
died
in
the
carthree
days
later
azarov
came
into
his

room
and
asked

vanovitch
all
at
once
turned
quite
white
and
without
uttering
a
word
rushed
to
his
study
from
which
he
returned
at
once
with
a
bit
of
caustic
in
his
hand
azarov

vanovitch

lancets
observed
azarov
as
he
walked
awayp
till
late
that
evening
and
all
the
following
day
assily
vanovitch
kept
catching
at
every
possible
excuse
to
go
into
his
sons
room
and
though
far
from
referring
to
the
cuthe
even
tried
to
talk
about
the
most
irrelevant
subjectshe
looked
so
persistently
into
his
face
and
watched
him
in
such
trepidation
that
azarov
lost
patience
and
threatened
to
go
away
assily
vanovitch
gave
him
a
promise
not
to
bother
him
the
more
readily
as
rina
lasyevna
from
whom
of
course
he
kept
it
all
secret
was
beginning
to
worry
him
as
to
why
he
did
not
sleep
and
what
had
come
over
him
or
two
whole
days
he
held
himself
in
though
he
did
not
at
all
like
the
look
of
his
son
whom
he
kept
watching
stealthily
but
on
the
third
day
at
dinner
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
azarov
sat
with
downcast
looks
and
had
not
touched
a
single
dishhy

inquired
putting
on
an
expression
of
the
most
perfect
carelessness

repeated
azarov
and
he
went
awayrina
lasyevna
busied
herself
about
the
preparation
of
the
decoction
of
limeflowers
while
assily
vanovitch
went
into
the
next
room
and
clutched
at
his
hair
in
silent
desperationazarov
did
not
get
up
again
that
day
and
passed
the
whole
night
in
heavy
halfunconscious
torpor
t
one
oclock
in
the
morning
opening
his
eyes
with
an
effort
he
saw
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
his
fathers
pale
face
bending
over
him
and
told
him
to
go
away
he
old
man
begged
his
pardon
but
he
quickly
came
back
on
tiptoe
and
halfhidden
by
the
cupboard
door
he
gazed
persistently
at
his
son
rina
lasyevna
did
not
go
to
bed
either
and
leaving
the
study
door
just
open
a
very
little
she
kept
coming
up
to
it
to
listen
how
nyusha
was
breathing
and
to
look
at
assily
vanovitch
he
could
see
nothing
but
his
motionless
bent
back
but
even
that
afforded
her
some
faint
consolation
n
the
morning
azarov
tried
to
get
up
he
was
seized
with
giddiness
his
nose
began
to
bleed
he
lay
down
again
assily
vanovitch
waited
on
him
in
silence
rina
lasyevna
went
in
to
him
and
asked
him
how
he
was
feeling
e
answered
etter
and
turned
to
the
wall
assily
vanovitch
gesticulated
at
his
wife
with
both
hands
she
bit
her
lips
so
as
not
to
cry
and
went
away
he
whole
house
seemed
suddenly
darkened
every
one
looked
gloomy
there
was
a
strange
hush
a
shrill
cock
was
carried
away
from
the
yard
to
the
village
unable
to
comprehend
why
he
should
be
treated
so
azarov
still
lay
turned
to
the
wall
assily
vanovitch
tried
to
address
him
with
various
questions
but
they
fatigued
azarov
and
the
old
man
sank
into
his
armchair
motionless
only
cracking
his
fingerjoints
now
and
then
e
went
for
a
few
minutes
into
the
garden
stood
there
like
a
statue
as
though
overwhelmed
with
unutterable
bewilderment
the
expression
of
amazement
never
left
his
face
all
through
and
went
back
again
to
his
son
trying
to
avoid
his
wifes
questions
he
caught
him
by
the
arm
at
last
and
passionately
almost
menacingly
said
hat
is
wrong
with
him
hen
he
came
to
himself
and
forced
himself
to
smile
at
her
in
reply
but
to
his
own
horror
instead
of
a
smile
he
found
himself
taken
somehow
by
a
fit
of
laughter
e
had
sent
at
daybreak
for
a
doctor
e
thought
it
necessary
to
inform
his
son
of
this
for
fear
he
should
be
angry
azarov
suddenly
turned
over
on
the
sofa
bent
a
fixed
dull
look
on
his
father
and
asked
for
drinkassily
vanovitch
gave
him
some
water
and
as
he
did
so
felt
his
forehead
t
seemed
on
fireovernor
began
azarov
in
a
slow
drowsy
voice

one
had
aimed
a
blow
at
his
legsevgeny

assily
vanovitch
while
the
tears
fairly
streamed
down
his
cheeksazarov
got
worse
every
hour
the
progress
of
the
disease
was
rapid
as
is
usually
the
way
in
cases
of
surgical
poisoning
e
still
had
not
lost

and
understood
what

brandy
rina
lasyevna
sat
on
a
low
stool
near
the
door
and
only
went
out
from
time
to
time
to
pray
few
days
before
a
lookingglass
had
slipped
out
of
her
hands
and
been
broken
and
this
she

resumed
its
onslaughts
assily
vanovitch
was
sitting
by
azarov
t
seemed
as
though
the
old
man
were
tormented
by
some
special
anguish
e
was
several
times
on
the
point
of
speakingand
could
notevgeny
he
brought
out
at
last
my
son
my
one
dear
sonhis
unfamiliar
mode
of
address
produced
an
effect
on
azarov
e
turned
his
head
a
little
and
obviously
trying
to
fight
against
the
load
of
oblivion
weighing
upon
him
he
articulated
hat
is
it
fatherevgeny
assily
vanovitch
went
on
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
azarov
though
the
latter
had
closed
his
eyes
and
could
not
see
him
evgeny

awful
but
still
more
awful
for

a
little
what
he
old
mans
voice

and
a
strange
look
passed
over
his
sons
face

he
still
lay
with
closed
eyes
wont
refuse
if
that
can
be
any
comfort
to
you
he
brought
out

his

back
on

from
his

down
in
the

his

sound
of
a
light
carriage
on
springs
that
sound
which
is
peculiarly
impressive
in
the
wilds
of
the
country
suddenly
struck
upon
his
hearing
earer
and
nearer
rolled
the
light
wheels
now
even
the
neighing
of
the
horses
could
be
heard
assily
vanovitch
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
little
window
here
drove
into
the
courtyard
of
his
little
house
a
carriage
with
seats
for
two
with
four
horses
harnessed
abreast
ithout
stopping
to
consider
what
it
could
mean
with
a
rush
of
a
sort
of
senseless
joy
he
ran
out
on
to
the

that

looked
at
azarov
and
stood
still
in

so
greatly
was
she
impressed
by
the
inflamed
and
at
the

time
deathly
face
with
its
dim
eyes
fastened
upon
her
he
felt
simply
dismayed
with
a
sort
of
cold
and
suffocating
dismay

thought
that
she
would
not
have

if

its

waved

feebly
ell
what

anuary
day
was
drawing
to
its
close
the
cold
evening
was
more
keen
than
ever
in
the
motionless
air
and
a
lurid
sunset
was
rapidly
dying
away
here
were
lights
burning
in
the
windows
of
the
house
at
aryino
rokofitch
in
a
black
frockcoat
and
white
gloves
with
a
special
solemnity
laid
the
table
for
seven
week
before
in
the
small
parish
church
two
weddings
had
taken
place
quietly
and
almost
without
witnessesrkady
and
atyas
and
ikolai
etrovitch
and
enitchkas
and
on
this
day
ikolai
etrovitch
was
giving
a
farewell
dinner
to
his
brother
who
was
going
away
to
oscow
on
business
nna
ergyevna
had
gone
there
also
directly
after
the
ceremony
was
over
after
making
very
handsome
presents
to
the
young
peoplerecisely
at
three
oclock
they
all
gathered
about
the
table
itya
was
placed
there
too
with
him
appeared
a
nurse
in
a
cap
of
glazed
brocade
avel
etrovitch
took
his
seat
between
atya
and
enitchka
the
husbands
took
their
places
beside
their
wives
ur
friends
had
changed
of
late
they
all
seemed
to
have
grown
stronger
and
better
looking
only
avel
etrovitch
was
thinner
which
gave
even
more
of
an
elegant
and
grand
seigneur
air
to
his
expressive
features
nd
enitchka
too
was
different
n
a
fresh
silk
gown
with
a
wide
velvet
headdress
on
her
hair
with
a
gold
chain
round
her
neck
she
sat
with
deprecating
immobility
respectful
towards
herself
and
everything
surrounding
her
and
smiled
as
though
she
would
say
beg
your
pardon
m
not
to
blame
nd
not
she
aloneall
the
others
smiled
and
also
seemed
apologetic
they
were
all
a
little
awkward
a
little
sorry
and
in
reality
very
happy
hey
all
helped
one
another
with
humorous
attentiveness
as
though
they
had
all
agreed
to
rehearse
a
sort
of
artless
farce
atya
was
the
most
composed
of
all
she
looked
confidently
about
her
and
it
could
be
seen
that
ikolai
etrovitch
was
already
devotedly
fond
of
her
t
the
end
of
dinner
he
got
up
and
his
glass
in
his
hand
turned
to
avel

began
not
for
long
to
be
sure

still

not
help
expressing
what

how
much

the
worst
of

all
good
luck
and
come
back
to
us
as
quickly
as
you
canavel
etrovitch
exchanged
kisses
with
every
one
of
course
not
excluding
itya
in
enitchkas
case
he
kissed
also
her
hand
which
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
offer
properly
and
drinking
off
the
glass
which
had
been
filled
again
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh

be
happy

his
nglish
finale
passed
unnoticed

warmly
in
response

he
did
not
venture
to
propose

seem

he
does
not

satisfaction

to

who
talk
with
chic
or

of
the
